Fvwm is a community driven project in which hundreds of
contributors have added to Fvwm though out the years by
adding features, modules, bug fixes, documentation,
configuration examples, and so on. If you would like
to ask the community for support, report bugs, commit
patches, or just stop by to say hello, contact us
using the following.

In addition to the human servants, cats
(![Cat face icon.]({{ site.baseurl }}/fvwm.ico))
have also been a big part of the Fvwm community. Check out
all of the [Fvwm cats](Cats/) that have contributed
to Fvwm. Without our Furry Feline Friends, Fvwm would
not have been the same.
