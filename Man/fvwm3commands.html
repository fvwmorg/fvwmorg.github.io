<h3 id="_miscellaneous_commands">Miscellaneous Commands</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>BugOpts</strong> [<em>option</em> [<em>bool</em>]], &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command controls several workarounds for bugs in third party
programs. The individual options are separated by commas. The optional
argument <em>bool</em> is a boolean argument and controls if the bug
workaround is enabled or not. It can either be "True" or "False" to
turn the option on or off, or "toggle" to switch is back and forth. If
<em>bool</em> is omitted, the default setting is restored.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>DebugRandR</em> activates monitor layout debug messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FlickeringMoveWorkaround</em> disables ConfigureNotify events that are
usually sent to an application while it is moved. If some windows
flicker annoyingly while being moved, this option may help you. Note
that if this problem occurs it is not an fvwm bug, it is a problem of
the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MixedVisualWorkaround</em> makes fvwm install the root colormap before it
does some operations using the root window visuals. This is only
useful when the <strong>-visual</strong> option is used to start fvwm and then only
with some configurations of some servers (e.g. Exceed 6.0 with an 8
bit PseudoColor root and fvwm using a 24 bit TrueColor visual).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>ModalityIsEvil</em> option controls whether Motif applications have
the ability to have modal dialogs (dialogs that force you to close
them first before you can do anything else). The default is to not
allow applications to have modal dialogs. Use this option with care.
Once this option is turned on, you have to restart fvwm to turn it
off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RaiseOverNativeWindows</em> makes fvwm try to raise the windows it
manages over native windows of the X server&#8217;s host system. This is
needed for some X servers running under Windows, Windows NT or Mac OS X.
Fvwm tries to detect if it is running under such an X server and
initializes the flag accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RaiseOverUnmanaged</em> makes fvwm try to raise the windows it manages
over override_redirect windows. This is used to cope with ill-mannered
applications that use long-lived windows of this sort, contrary to
ICCCM conventions. It is useful with the <em>Unmanaged</em> style option too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FlickeringQtDialogsWorkaround</em> suppresses flickering of the focused
window in some modules when using KDE or QT applications with
application modal dialog windows. By default this option is turned on.
This option may be visually disturbing for other applications using
windows not managed by fvwm. Since these applications are rare it is
most likely safe to leave this option at its default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>QtDragnDropWorkaround</em> suppresses the forwarding of unknown
ClientEvent messages to windows&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually this is harmless, but Qt
has problems handling unrecognised ClientEvent messages. Enabling this
option might therefore help for Qt applications using DragnDrop. This
option is off by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHIconicStateWorkaround</em> is needed by EWMH compliant pagers or
taskbars which represent windows which are on a different desktops as
iconified. These pagers and taskbars use a version of the EWMH
specification before version 1.2 (the current KDE 2 &amp; 3 versions).
These pagers and taskbars use the IconicState WM_STATE state to
determine if an application is iconified. This state, according to the
ICCCM, does not imply that a window is iconified (in the usual sense).
Turning on this option forces fvwm to establish an equivalence between
the IconicState WM_STATE state and the iconified window. This violates
ICCCM compliance but should not cause big problems. By default this
option is off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>DisplayNewWindowNames</em> enabled, fvwm prints the name, icon
name (if available), resource and class of new windows to the console.
This can help in finding the correct strings to use in the <strong>Style</strong>
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the <em>ExplainWindowPlacement</em> option is enabled, fvwm prints a
message to the console whenever a new window is placed or
<strong>PlaceAgain</strong>, is used. The message explains on which desk, page,
screen and position it was placed and why. This option can be used to
figure out why a specific window does not appear where you think it
should.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>DebugCRMotionMethod</em> option enables some debugging code in the
ConfigureRequest handling routines of fvwm. It is not helpful for the
user, but if you report a bug to the fvwm team we may ask you to
enable this option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>TransliterateUtf8</em> option enables transliteration during
conversions from utf-8 strings. By default fvwm will not transliterate
during conversion, but will fall back to alternate strings provided by
the clients if conversion from utf-8 fails due to characters which
have no direct correspondence in the target charecter set. Some
clients however neglect to set non utf-8 properties correctly in which
case this option may help.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>BusyCursor</strong> [<em>Option</em> <em>bool</em>], &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command controls the cursor during the execution of certain
commands. <em>Option</em> can be <em>DynamicMenu</em>, <em>ModuleSynchronous</em>, <em>Read</em>,
<em>Wait</em> or <em>*</em>. An option must be followed by a boolean argument
<em>bool</em>. You can use commas to separate individual options. If you set
an option to "True", then when the corresponding command is run, fvwm
displays the cursor of the <em>WAIT</em> context of the <strong>CursorStyle</strong>
command. "False" forces to not display the cursor. The default is:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>BusyCursor DynamicMenu False, ModuleSynchronous False, \
Read False, Wait False</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>*</em> option refers to all available options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Read</em> option controls the <strong>PipeRead</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>DynamicMenu</em> option affects the <em>DynamicPopupAction</em> and
<em>MissingSubmenuFunction</em> options of the <strong>AddToMenu</strong> command. If this
option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not displayed during
a dynamic menu command even if this command is a <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>PipeRead</strong>
command and the <em>Read</em> option is set to "True".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>ModuleSynchronous</em> option affects the <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong>
command. If this option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not
displayed while fvwm waits for a module started by <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong>
to complete its startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Wait</em> option affects only the root cursor. During a wait pause
the root cursor is replaced by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully
functional (you can escape from the pause, see the <strong>EscapeFunc</strong>
command). If you want to use this option and if you do not use the
default root cursor, you must set your root cursor with the
<strong>CursorStyle</strong> command.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ClickTime</strong> [<em>delay</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the maximum delay in milliseconds between a button press and
a button release for the <strong>Function</strong> command to consider the action a
mouse click. The default delay is 150 milliseconds. Omitting the delay
value resets the <strong>ClickTime</strong> to the default.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ClickTime also specifies the delay between two clicks to be interpreted as a
double-click.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ColorLimit</strong> <em>limit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is obsolete. See the <strong>--color-limit</strong> option to fvwm.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ColormapFocus</strong> FollowsMouse | FollowsFocus</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, fvwm installs the colormap of the window that the cursor
is in. If you use</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>ColormapFocus FollowsFocus</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then the installed colormap is the one for the window that currently
has the keyboard focus.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>CursorStyle</strong> <em>context</em> [<em>num</em> | <em>name</em> | None | Tiny | <em>file</em> [<em>x</em> <em>y</em>] [<em>fg</em> <em>bg</em>]]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Defines a new cursor for the specified context. Note that this command
can not control the shapes an applications uses, for example, to
indicate that it is busy. The various contexts are:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The defaults are shown in parentheses above. If you ever want to
restore the default cursor for a specific context you can omit the
second argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second argument is either the numeric value of the cursor as
defined in the include file <em>X11/cursorfont.h</em> or its name (without
the XC_ prefix). Alternatively, the xpm file name may be specified.
The name can also be <em>None</em> (no cursor) or <em>Tiny</em> (a single pixel as
the cursor).</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, the cursor can be loaded from an (XPM, PNG or SVG)
image <em>file</em>. If fvwm is compiled with Xcursor support, full ARGB is
used, and (possibly animated) cursor files made with the <strong>xcursorgen</strong>
program can be loaded. Otherwise the cursor is converted to
monochrome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optional <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments (following a <em>file</em> argument)
specifies the hot-spot coordinate with 0 0 as the top left corner of
the image. Coordinates within the image boundary are valid and
overrides any hot-spot defined in the (XPM/Xcursor) image file. An
invalid or undefined hot-spot is placed in the center of the image.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>DefaultFont</strong> [<em>fontname</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>DefaultFont</strong> sets the default font to font <em>fontname</em>. The default
font is used by fvwm whenever no other font has been specified. To
reset the default font to the built-in default, omit the argument. The
default font is used for menus, window titles, icon titles as well as
the geometry feedback windows during a move or resize operation. To
override the default font in a specific context, use the <strong>Style</strong> *
<em>Font</em>, <strong>Style</strong> * <em>IconFont</em>, or <strong>MenuStyle</strong> commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>DefaultIcon</strong> <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the default icon which is used if a window has neither an
client-supplied icon nor an icon supplied via the <em>Icon</em> option of the
<strong>Style</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>DefaultLayers</strong> <em>bottom</em> <em>put</em> <em>top</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes the layers that are used for the <em>StaysOnBottom</em>, <em>StaysPut</em>,
<em>StaysOnTop</em> <strong>Style</strong> options. Initially, the layers 2, 4 and 6 are
used.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Deschedule</strong> [<em>command_id</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes all commands that were scheduled with the id <em>command_id</em> with
the <strong>Schedule</strong> command from the list of commands to be executed unless
they were already executed. If the <em>command_id</em> is omitted, the value
of the variable $[schedule.last] is used as the id.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Emulate</strong> Fvwm | Mwm | Win</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are done by
fvwm. Right now this command affects where the move/resize feedback
window appears and how window placement is aborted. To have more Mwm-
or Win-like behavior you can call <strong>Emulate</strong> with <em>Mwm</em> or <em>Win</em> as its
argument. With Mwm resize and move feedback windows are in the center
of the screen, instead of the upper left corner. This also affects how
manual placement is aborted. See the <em>ManualPlacement</em> description.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>EscapeFunc</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>By default the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape allows for escaping from a
<strong>Wait</strong> pause and from a locked <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command. The
<strong>EscapeFunc</strong> command used with the <strong>Key</strong> command allows for
configuring this key sequence. An example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Key Escape A MC -
Key Escape A  S EscapeFunc</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>replaces the Ctrl-Alt-Escape  key sequence with Shift-Escape for aborting a
<strong>Wait</strong> pause and <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command.  <strong>EscapeFunc</strong> used outside the
<strong>Key</strong> command does nothing.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>FakeClick</strong> [<em>command</em> <em>value</em>] &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees
are made that it works for you. <em>FakeClick</em> can simulate mouse button
press and release events and pass them to fvwm or the applications.
The parameters are a list of commands which consist of pairs of
<em>command</em> tokens and integer <em>values</em>, The <em>press</em> and <em>release</em>
commands are followed by the appropriate mouse button number and
generate a button press or release event on the window below the
pointer. The <em>wait</em> commands pauses fvwm for the given number of
milliseconds. The <em>modifiers</em> command simulates pressing or releasing
modifier keys. The values 1 to 5 are mapped to Mod1 to Mod5 while 6, 7
and 8 are mapped to Shift, Lock and Control. The modifier is set for
any further button events. To release a modifier key, use the
corresponding negative number. The <em>depth</em> command determines to which
window the button events are sent. With a depth of 1, all events go to
the root window, regardless of the pointer&#8217;s position. With 2, the
event is passed to the top level window under the pointer which is
usually the frame window. With 3, events go to the client window.
Higher numbers go to successive sub windows. Zero (0) goes to the
smallest window that contains the pointer. Note that events propagate
upward.</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FakeClick depth 2 press 1 wait 250 release 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This simulates a click with button 1 in the parent window (depth 2)
with a delay of 250 milliseconds between the press and the release.
Note: all command names can be abbreviated with their first letter.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>FakeKeypress</strong> [<em>command</em> <em>value</em>] &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees

and release events and pass them to fvwm or applications. The
parameters are a list of commands which consist of pairs of command
tokens and values. The <em>press</em> and <em>release</em> commands are followed by
a key name. The key name is a standard X11 key name as defined in
<em>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</em>, (without the <em>XK_</em> prefix), or the
keysym database <em>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</em>. The <em>wait</em>,

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ImagePath</strong> <em>path</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
images (both monochrome and pixmap). To find an image given by a
relative pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in turn, and
uses the first file found.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;.ext", this means all
images in this directory have the extension ".ext" that should be
forced. The original image name (that may contain another extension or
no extension at all) is not probed, instead ".ext" is added or
replaces the original extension. This is useful, for example, if a
user has some image directories with ".xpm" images and other image
directories with the same names, but ".png" images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>path</em> may contain environment variables such as <em>$HOME</em> (or
<em>${HOME}</em>). Further, a '+' in the <em>path</em> is expanded to the previous
value of the path, allowing appending or prepending to the path
easily.</p>

<p>The <em>command</em> is executed after about <em>delay_ms</em> milliseconds. This
may be useful in some tricky setups. The <em>command</em> is executed in the
same context window as the <strong>Schedule</strong> command. An optional integer
argument <em>command_id</em> may be given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal
format. This id can be used with the <strong>Deschedule</strong> command to remove
the scheduled command before it is executed. If no id is given, fvwm
uses negative id numbers, starting with -1 and decreasing by one with
each use of the <strong>Schedule</strong> command. Note that the <strong>Schedule</strong> command
and its arguments undergo the usual command line expansion, and, when
<em>command</em> is finally executed, it is expanded again. It may therefore
be necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not be
expanded twice.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: A window&#8217;s id as it is returned with $[w.id] can be used as the

<em>NoGeometryWithInfo</em> removes the geometries, but keep the desktop
information and indicates iconic windows. <em>NoDeskNum</em> causes fvwm to
not display the desktop number in the geometry or before the window
title with the <em>NoGeometryWithInfo</em> option. <em>NoNumInDeskTitle</em> is only
useful if a desktop name is defined with the <strong>DesktopName</strong> command. It
causes fvwm to not display the desktop number before the desktop name.
By default, the WindowList menu have a title which indicates the
current desk or the selected desktop if the <em>Desk</em> condition is used.
The <em>NoCurrentDeskTitle</em> option removes this title. <em>TitleForAllDesks</em>
causes fvwm to add a menu title with the desk name and/or number
before each group of windows on the same desk. With <em>NoLayer</em>, the
layer of the window is not displayed. The options <em>ShowPage</em>,
<em>ShowPageX</em> and <em>ShowPageY</em> enable displaying the page of the window
rounded multiples of the display size. With <em>ShowScreen</em>, the window&#8217;s
screen name is displayed.</p>

the center of the window is on. If the trailing option <em>ewmhiwa</em> is
given, then the window position will ignore the working area and its
position will not be adjusted (this option is needed to move windows
off the screen and to have full control of where it is placed). If
the option <em>Warp</em> is given then the pointer is warped to the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the literal option <em>screen</em> followed by a RandR screen name <em>S</em> is
specified, the coordinates are interpreted as relative to the given
screen. The width and height of the screen are used for the
calculations instead of the display dimensions. The <em>screen</em> is
interpreted as in the <strong>MoveToScreen</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the literal option <em>desk</em> followed by a desk number <em>N</em> is specified,
place the window on the specified desk after it has been moved. This can
serve two purposes, first you can move a window&#8217;s position and desk in a
single command. Second when a window is moved between monitors, its desk
is updated to be the same as the new monitor. This option can override
that behavior by specifying which desk the window should end up on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The positional arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can specify an absolute or relative
position from either the left/top (positive values) or right/bottom
(negative values) of the global screen (the bounding box that contains all
monitors) or specified <em>screen</em>. By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the screen&#8217;s width/height, but a trailing
'<em>p</em>' changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing '<em>w</em>'
means percent of the window width/height. To move the window relative to
its current position, add the '<em>w</em>' (for "window") prefix before the <em>x</em>
and/or <em>y</em> value. To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the '<em>m</em>' (for "mouse") prefix. To move the
window relative to the virtual screen coordinates, add the '<em>v</em>' (for
"virtual screen") prefix. This is mostly for internal use with FvwmPager,
but can be used to give exact coordinates on the virtual screen and is best
used with the '<em>p</em>' suffix. To leave either coordinate unchanged, "<em>keep</em>"
can be specified in place of <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For advanced uses, the arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can be used multiple
times, but without the prefix '<em>m</em>' or '<em>w</em>'. (See complex examples
below).</p>

moved to the current page (a window that has the focus but is
off-screen can be retrieved with this). Moving windows to a page
relative to the current page can be achieved by adding a trailing
'<em>p</em>' after any or both numerical arguments. To move the window

<p>A cursor barrier is a box that the cursor cannot be moved outside of
(unless warped with <em>CursorMove</em> or <em>WarpToWindow</em>). The <em>left</em>, <em>top</em>,
<em>right</em>, and <em>bottom</em> values give the percent distance the box is placed
from each of the corresponding edges of the desktop. If the values end
with a <em>p</em>, they are interpreted as pixel amounts instead. If the option
<em>coords</em> is given, the values are interpreted as the left/top and
right/bottom coordinates of the box&#8217;s corners. If the option
<em>screen RandRname</em> is given, the positions are computed relative to the
specified monitor. Use <em>screen c</em> to place the barrier on the current
monitor.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple barriers can be created by calling <em>CursorBarrier</em> multiple times.
This allows creating multiple regions to confine the cursor to (such as each
monitor in a multi-monitor setup), then use <em>CursorMove</em> or <em>WarpToWindow</em>
to move the cursor between the barriers. If the command <em>destroy</em> is included,
all barriers are destroyed allowing free movement of the mouse again. If
<em>destroy</em> is followed by an integer <em>N</em>, only that barrier is destroyed
(barriers are numbered in the order they are created starting at 0). If the
integer is negative, this counts backwards, such as "-1" is the most recent
created barrier, "-2" is the second most recent, and so on. When a barrier
is destroyed, this renumbers all barriers after it. In practice this is
best used with <em>destroy -1</em> to destroy the most recent barrier without
affecting any previously created barriers.</p>

<p>Iconifies a window if it is not already iconified or de-iconifies it
if it is already iconified. The optional argument <em>bool</em> is a boolean
argument. "<em>True</em>" means only iconification is allowed, while
"<em>False</em>" forces de-iconification. Using "<em>toggle</em>" switches between
iconified and de-iconified states.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of <strong>Style</strong> options which influence the appearance
and behavior of icons (e.g. <em>StickyIcon</em>, <em>NoIcon</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

positive number instead of "True", or a negative number instead of

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Maximize</strong> [<em>flags</em>] [<em>bool | forget</em>] [<em>horizontal</em>[p]] [<em>vertical</em>[p]]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Without its optional arguments (or if the <em>bool</em> bit has the value
"<em>toggle</em>") <strong>Maximize</strong> causes the window to alternately switch from a
full-screen size to its normal size. To force a window into maximized
(normal) state you can use a "<em>True</em>" or "<em>False</em>" value for the
<em>bool</em> argument.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With just the parameter "forget" a maximized window reverts back into
normal state but keeps its current maximized size. This can be useful
in conjunction with the commands <strong>ResizeMaximize</strong> and
<strong>ResizeMoveMaximize</strong>. If the window is not maximized, nothing happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the optional arguments <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em>, which are
expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can control the new
size of the window. An optional suffix '<em>p</em>' can be used to indicate
pixels instead of percents of the screen size. If horizontal is
greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension of the window is set to
<em>horizontal</em>*screen_width/100. If the value is smaller than 0 the size
is subtracted from the screen width, i.e. -25 is the same as 75. If
<em>horizontal</em> is "<em>grow</em>", it is maximized to current available space
until finding any obstacle. The vertical resizing is similar. If both
horizontal and vertical values are "grow", it expands vertically
first, then horizontally to find space. Instead of the horizontal
"grow" argument, "<em>growleft</em>" or "<em>growright</em>" can be used
respectively "<em>growup</em>" and "<em>growdown</em>".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optional <em>flags</em> argument is a space separated list containing the
following key words: <em>fullscreen</em>, <em>ewmhiwa</em>, <em>growonwindowlayer</em>,
<em>growonlayers</em>, <em>keepgrowing</em>, <em>all_windows</em>, <em>both_sides</em>, and <em>screen</em>.
<em>fullscreen</em> causes the window to become fullscreened if the appropriate
EWMH hint is set. <em>ewmhiwa</em> causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working area.
<em>growonwindowlayer</em> causes the various grow methods to ignore windows with
a layer other than the current layer of the window which is maximized. The
<em>growonlayers</em> option must have two integer arguments. The first one is
the minimum layer and the second one the maximum layer to use. Windows that
are outside of this range of layers are ignored by the grow methods. A
negative value as the first or second argument means to assume no minimum
or maximum layer. The <em>all_windows</em> option will consider all windows on the
same monitor in the direction the window is growing. This can be used to
grow a window to the edge of a window it is next to. The option <em>both_sides</em>
will consider both sides of other windows when growing (by default only the
close side is considered). This can be used to grow a window to the
boundaries of a window it is currently inside of. <em>keepgrowing</em> will allow
the window to keep growing beyond any window boundary it is currently
touching until it grows into the next closest window boundary. <em>screen</em>
must have an argument which specifies the screen on which to operate.</p>

"<em>toggle</em>", the window shade state is toggled. If <em>bool</em> is "True",
the window is forced to the shaded state. If <em>bool</em> is "False", then
the window is forced to the non-shaded state. To force shading in a
certain direction, the <em>direction</em> argument can be used. Any of the
strings "<em>North</em>", "<em>South</em>", "<em>West</em>", "<em>East</em>", "<em>NorthWest</em>",
"<em>NorthEast</em>", "<em>SouthWest</em>", "<em>SouthEast</em>" or "<em>Last</em>" can be given.
The direction can be abbreviated with the usual one or two letters
"<em>N</em>", "<em>NW</em>", etc. Using a direction on a window that was already
shaded unshades the window. To shade it in a different direction, use
the <em>ShadeAgain</em> option. The direction <em>Last</em> shades the window in the
direction it last was shaded. If the window has never been shaded
before it is shaded as if no direction had been given. Windows without
titles can be shaded too. Please refer also to the options
<em>WindowShadeSteps</em>, <em>WindowShadeShrinks</em>, <em>WindowShadeScrolls</em>,

if the num-lock and scroll-lock keys interfere with your shortcuts. With

partially. Complex functions can not be used with these buttons and
neither any operation that requires dragging the pointer with the

<p><em>Context</em> describes where the binding applies. Valid contexts are
'<em>R</em>' for the root window, '<em>W</em>' for an application window, '<em>D</em>' for

<p>In order to enable page scrolling via the mouse, four windows called
the "pan frames" are placed at the very edge of the screen. This is
how fvwm detects the mouse&#8217;s presence at the window edge. Because of
the way this works, they need to be at the top of the stack and eat
mouse events, so if you have any kind of error along the lines of:
"mouse clicks at the edge of the screen do the wrong thing" you&#8217;re
having trouble with the pan frames and (assuming you do not use the
mouse to flip between pages) should set the EdgeThickness to 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A value of 0 completely disables mouse edge scrolling, even while

<p>Where left, right, top and bottom are positive or null integers which
define bands at the edge of the screen. If <em>screen</em> is given, followed
by the RANDRNAME of a given display, then the EwmhBaseStruts are
defined for just RANDRNAME. <em>left</em> defines a band on the left of your

screen of width <em>right</em>, <em>top</em> defines a band on the top of your
screen of height <em>top</em> and <em>bottom</em> defines a band on the bottom of
your screen of height <em>bottom</em>. The unit is the pixel and the default
is 0 0 0 0. These areas define additional reserved space to the

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>EwmhNumberOfDesktops</strong> <em>num</em> [<em>max</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar (as
kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm modules ( <strong>FvwmPager</strong> or
<strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>). It causes a compliant application to consider at least
<em>num</em> desktops (desktop 0 to desktop <em>num</em>-1). The optional argument
<em>max</em> causes a compliant application to never consider more than <em>max</em>
desktops. If <em>max</em> is 0 (the default) there is no limitation. The
actual number of desktops is determined dynamically. It is at least
<em>num</em>, but it can be d if there is a window on desktop d-1 (or if the
current desktop is desktop d-1) and d is less or equal to <em>max</em> or
<em>max</em> is null. Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change <em>num</em>
itself. This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is less than or
equal to <em>max</em> or if <em>max</em> is null. Note that negative desktops are
not supported by the ewmh specification. The default is 4 0.</p>

interpreted as a relative desk number. Two arguments are understood as
a relative and an absolute desk number. Three arguments specify a

arguments specify the relative, absolute, minimum and maximum values.
If a literal <em>prev</em> is given as the single argument, the last visited

<p>The purpose of this command is to store internal information to fvwm

the environment, which pollutes it and makes the information global to
other processes started by fvwm which may then modify them which might
not be what&#8217;s wanted. Hence the point of <strong>InfoStoreAdd</strong> is to still
allow for such information to be stored, but kept internal to fvwm.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The redirection causes any output from the program to go to stderr
instead of being read as a sequence of commands by fvwm. <strong>PipeRead</strong>
returns 1 if the given command could be executed or -1 if not (see the
section <strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for the meaning of return codes).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Read</strong> <em>filename</em> [quiet]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named <em>filename</em>. If the
keyword <em>Quiet</em> follows the command no message is produced if the file
is not found. If the file name does not begin with a slash ('/'), fvwm
looks in the user&#8217;s data directory, then the system data directory.
The user&#8217;s data directory is by default <em>$HOME/.fvwm</em>. It can be
overridden by exporting <em>FVWM_USERDIR</em> set to any other directory. The
<strong>Read</strong> command returns 1 if the given file could be read or -1 if not
(see the section <strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for the meaning of return
codes).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>SetEnv</strong> <em>variable</em> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to the shell&#8217;s
export or setenv command. The <em>variable</em> and its <em>value</em> are inherited
by processes started directly by fvwm. For example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Silent</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A number of commands require a window to operate on. If no window was
selected when such a function is invoked the user is asked to select a
window. Sometimes this behavior is unwanted, for example if the
function was called by a module and the window that was selected at
first does not exist anymore. You can prevent this by putting <strong>Silent</strong>
in front of the fvwm <em>command</em>. If a function that needs a window is
called with <strong>Silent</strong> without a window selected, it simply returns
without doing anything. If <strong>Silent</strong> is used on a user defined function
it affects all function and sub function calls until the original
function exits.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another usage of <strong>Silent</strong> is with binding commands <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>PointerKey</strong>
and <strong>Mouse</strong>, this disables error messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Silent</strong> also disables the error message for non-existent commands.
Note: This command is treated as a prefix to its <em>command</em>. Expansion
of the command line is done as if <strong>Silent</strong> was not there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Silent Move 0 0

inherited by processes started directly by fvwm.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Wait</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only. It causes
execution of a function to pause until a new window matching <em>window</em>
appears. This can be a window&#8217;s name, class, or resource string. It
may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the usual
Unix filename manner. This is particularly useful in the
"InitFunction" if you are trying to start windows on specific
desktops:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + I Wait xterm
 + I GotoDesk 0 2
 + I Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
 507x750+0+0
 + I Wait xmh
 + I GotoDesk 0 0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it
to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the
xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input from
the modules is queued up and processed only after the window appears
or the command is aborted. For example, windows can not be focused
with <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> or <strong>FvwmPager</strong> during a wait.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can escape from a <strong>Wait</strong> pause by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape (where Alt is
the first modifier). To redefine this key sequence see the <strong>EscapeFunc</strong> command.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Status</strong> <em>On | Off</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns status either On or Off. This sends information in JSON format
down a named pipe (set via FVWM_STATUS_PIPE env var) about the current
desks and number of windows, etc. This is meant to provide a fast
means of supplying third-party tools information about what&#8217;s
happening in Fvwm. For example, the JSON could be manipulated and sent
to tools such as <em>lemonbar</em>, <em>polybar</em>, etc.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format of the JSON blob looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="_conditional_commands">Conditional Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conditional commands are commands that are only executed if certain
conditions are met. Most conditional commands work on windows, like
<strong>Next</strong>, <strong>ThisWindow</strong> or <strong>All</strong>. There is one conditional command, <strong>Test</strong>,
that works on global conditions unrelated to windows. The syntax of the
conditions is described below. For readability, the list of conditions
is located at the end of this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Return Codes</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for the
command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the condition was
met) or 0 (if the condition was not met). Some commands may return -1
which means that an error occurred and the return code is useless. The
<strong>Break</strong> command returns -2. Additionally, the return codes of commands
run in a complex functions are passed to the invoking complex
function. The return code is used by the <strong>TestRc</strong> command. Please
refer to the commands' description for examples. The return code can
also be accessed through the variable <em>$[cond.rc]</em>. Non conditional
commands do not modify the return code of the last conditional
command. Important note: return codes are only defined inside
functions created with the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command and are not inherited
by sub functions. To run a command without altering the return code,
the <strong>KeepRc</strong> command can be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>The Ring of Windows</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally. Think of the focused window
as a cursor on the current position in the ring. The <strong>Next</strong> command
and many other commands search forwards through the ring for a
matching window, and <strong>Prev</strong> searches backwards. The windows in the
ring are either ordered by creation time (if the
<em>!FPSortWindowlistByFocus</em>, <em>NeverFocus</em> or <em>MouseFocus</em> styles are
used) or by the last time they had the focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>List of Conditional Commands</strong></dt>
<dd>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>All</strong> [<em>options</em>] [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Execute <em>command</em> on all windows meeting the conditions. It returns 1
if any window matches the condition and 0 otherwise. The execution
starts at the top of the window ring and continues towards the bottom.
The <em>options</em> can be any combination of <em>Reverse</em> and <em>UseStack</em>. If
the option <em>Reverse</em> is given the execution order is reversed. The
option <em>UseStack</em> makes All use the stacking order instead of the
window ring when walking through windows. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section
for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em>

<em>!CirculateHit</em> etc. explicitly.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Any</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if any window which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>
exists. The command is run in the context of the root window. See
the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Break</strong> [<em>levels</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the break command is used in a function, function execution is
terminated immediately. Further commands of the function are not
processed. Normally, all nested invocations of complex functions are
left. An optional integer number <em>levels</em> may be given to break out
of the given number of nested functions and continue execution of a
higher level function. The <strong>Break</strong> command always has the return
code -2. Example:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
+ I Pick
+ I TestRc (Error) Break
+ I Raise
+ I Iconify off</pre>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Current</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> on the currently focused window if it satisfies
all <em>conditions</em>. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of
conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Direction</strong> [FromPointer] <em>direction</em> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. Normally, the center of
the currently focused window or the context window in which the
command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
window, or when the <em>FromPointer</em> option is given, the current
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
<em>direction</em> may be one of "North", "Northeast", "East", "Southeast",
"South", "Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and "Center". Which window
<strong>Direction</strong> selects depends on angle and distance between the center
points of the windows. Closer windows are considered a better match
than those farther away. The <em>Center</em> direction simply selects the
window closest to the starting point. Returns -1 if an invalid
direction was given. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of
conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>KeepRc</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Runs the <em>command</em> but does not alter the return code of the
previous command. Note: <strong>KeepRc</strong> is treated as a prefix to its
<em>command</em>. Expansion of the command line is done as if <strong>KeepRc</strong> was
not there.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Next</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on the next window which
satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. If the command is running in a window
context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section
for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>None</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if no window which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>
exists. The command is run in the context of the root window.
Returns 1 if no window matches the conditions and 0 otherwise. See
<strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,
<em>CirculateHitIcon</em> and <em>CirculateHitShaded</em>. They can be turned off

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>NoWindow</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em>, but removes the window context if any. This is
not really a conditional command, but a prefix that may be useful in
menu items that should operate without a window even if such menu is
bound to window decorations.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Pick</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Pick</strong> works like <strong>Function</strong> if invoked in the context of a window.
If invoked in the root window, it first asks the user to pick a
window and then executes the <em>command</em> in the context of that
window. This avoids annoying multiple selections with complex
functions. The command is executed only if the given <em>conditions</em>
are met. Returns -1 if no window was selected. See <strong>Conditions</strong>
section for a list of conditions.</p>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>PointerWindow</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if the window under the pointer satisfies all
<em>conditions</em>. Returns -1 if there is no window under the pointer.
See <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,
<em>CirculateHitIcon</em> and <em>CirculateHitShaded</em>. They can be turned off

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Prev</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on the previous window which
satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. If the command is running in a window
context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section
for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ScanForWindow</strong> [FromPointer] <em>dir1</em> <em>dir2</em> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. Normally, the center of
the currently focused window or the context window in which the
command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
window, or when the <em>FromPointer</em> option is given, the current
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
direction <em>dir1</em> may be one of "North", "NorthEast", "East",
"SouthEast", "South", "SouthWest", "West", and "NorthWest". Which
window <strong>ScanForWindow</strong> selects depends first on the position along
the primary axis given by <em>dir1</em>. If any windows have the exact same
coordinate along the primary axis, the secondary direction is used
to order the windows. The direction <em>dir2</em> may be one of the same
set of values as <em>dir1</em>. If <em>dir2</em> is not perfectly perpendicular to
<em>dir1</em>, ScanForWindow returns a failure. When using ScanForWindow
repeatedly with the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all
windows matching the conditions will eventually be found. If the
focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will wrap around to
the opposite side. Returns -1 if an invalid direction was given. See
<strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Test</strong> [(<em>test-conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if all <em>test-conditions</em> are satisfied. The
<em>test-conditions</em> are keywords with possible arguments from the list
below and are separated by commas or whitespace. They include:
<em>Version operator x.y.z</em>, <em>EnvIsSet varname</em>, <em>EnvMatch varname
pattern</em>, <em>EdgeHasPointer direction</em>, <em>EdgeIsActive direction</em>,
<em>Start</em>, <em>Init</em>, <em>Restart</em>, <em>Exit</em>, <em>Quit</em>, <em>ToRestart</em>, <em>True</em>,
<em>False</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>W</em>, <em>X</em> and <em>I</em>. A test-condition prefixed with
"!" is negated.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Version</em> <em>operator x.y.z</em> test-condition is fulfilled if the
logical condition of the expression is true. Valid <em>operator</em> values

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>EnvIsSet</em> <em>varname</em> test-condition is true if the given
environment variable is set. The <em>EnvMatch</em> <em>varname pattern</em>
test-condition is true if <em>pattern</em> matches the given environment or
infostore variable value. (See <strong>InfoStoreAdd</strong>). The pattern may
contain special "*" and "?" chars. The "varname" is coded without
the leading dollar sign ($).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>EdgeHasPointer</em> [<em>direction</em>] test-condition is true if the
edge in the given direction currently contains the pointer. The
<em>EdgeIsActive</em> [<em>direction</em>] test-condition is true if the edge in
the given direction currently is active. An edge is active, and can
contain a pointer if either a command is bound to it or edge scroll
is available in that direction. The direction may be one of *
Any<em>,</em> North<em>,</em> Top<em>,</em> Up<em>,</em> West<em>,</em> Left<em>,</em> South<em>,</em>
Bottom<em>, </em> Down<em>,</em> Right* and * East<em>. If no direction is
specified </em>Any* is assumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Start</em> test-condition is the same as either <em>Init</em> or

(match), -1 (error), and -2 (break) the symbolic names "<em>NoMatch</em>",
"<em>Match</em>", "<em>Error</em>" and "<em>Break</em>" can be used. If no <em>returncode</em>

<p>The <strong>WindowId</strong> command looks for a specific window <em>id</em> and runs the
specified <em>command</em> on it. The second form of syntax retrieves the
window id of the root window. The window indicated by
<em>id</em> may belong to a window not managed by fvwm. Although most
commands can not operate on such windows, there are some exceptions,
for example the <strong>WarpToWindow</strong> command. Returns -1 if no window with
the given id exists. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,

<dd>
<p>The <em>conditions</em> that may be given as an argument to any conditional
command are a list of keywords separated by commas, enclosed in
parentheses. Unless stated otherwise, conditional commands accept all
the conditions listed below. Note that earlier versions of fvwm
required the conditions to be separated by whitespace instead of
commas and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses (this is still
supported for backward compatibility).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the <em>conditions</em> may include one or more window names to
match to. If more than one window name is given, all of them must
match. The window name, icon name, class, and resource are considered
when attempting to find a match. Each name may include the wildcards
'*' and '?', and may consist of two or more alternatives, separated by
the character '|', which acts as an OR operator. (If OR operators are
used, they must not be separated by spaces from the names.) Each
window name can begin with '!', which prevents <em>command</em> if any of the
window name, icon name, class or resource match. However, '!' must not
be applied to individual names in a group separated by OR operators;
it may only be applied to the beginning of the group, and then it
operates on the whole group.</p>

<strong>FvwmEvent</strong>, <strong>FvwmForm</strong>, <strong>FvwmPager</strong>, <strong>FvwmScript</strong> support aliases.
Aliases are useful if more than one instance of the module should be
spawned. Aliases may be configured separately using <strong>*</strong> syntax. To
start a module <strong>FvwmForm</strong> using an alias <em>MyForm</em>, the following
syntax may be used:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the current time the available modules (included with fvwm) are
<strong>FvwmAnimate</strong> (produces animation effects when a window is iconified
or de-iconified), <strong>FvwmAuto</strong> (an auto raise module), <strong>FvwmBacker</strong> (to
change the background when you change desktops), <strong>FvwmBanner</strong> (to
display a spiffy XBM, XPM, PNG or SVG), <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> (brings up a
customizable tool bar), <strong>FvwmCommandS</strong> (a command server to use with
shell&#8217;s FvwmCommand client), <strong>FvwmConsole</strong> (to execute fvwm commands

<strong>FvwmRearrange</strong> (to rearrange windows), <strong>FvwmScript</strong> (another powerful
dialog toolkit), These modules have their own man pages. There may be
other modules out on there as well.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules can be short lived transient programs or, like <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> ,
can remain for the duration of the X session. Modules are terminated
by the window manager prior to restarts and quits, if possible. See
the introductory section on modules. The keyword <strong>Module</strong> may be
omitted if <em>modulename</em> is distinct from all fvwm commands.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ModuleListenOnly</strong> <em>modulename</em> [<em>moduleparams</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command works like the <strong>Module</strong> command, but fvwm never sends any
messages to the module. This may be handy to write a module as a shell
script that is triggered by external events without the burden to
answer packets sent by fvwm. For example, a module written as a shell
script may change labels of the <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> module to implement a
simple clock.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ModulePath</strong> <em>path</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
modules. To find a module, fvwm searches each directory in turn and
uses the first file found. Directory names on the list do not need
trailing slashes.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>ModulePath</strong> may contain environment variables such as <em>$HOME</em> (or
<em>${HOME}</em>). Further, a '+' in the <em>path</em> is expanded to the previous
value of the <em>path</em>, allowing easy appending or prepending to the
<em>path</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> [Expect <em>string</em>] [Timeout <em>secs</em>] <em>modulename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command is very similar to <strong>Module</strong>. Fvwm
stops processing any commands and user input until the module sends a
string beginning with "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" back to fvwm. If the
optional <em>Timeout</em> is given fvwm gives up if the module sent no input
back to fvwm for <em>secs</em> seconds. If the <em>Expect</em> option is given, fvwm
waits for the given <em>string</em> instead. <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> should only
be used during fvwm startup to enforce the order in which modules are
started. This command is intended for use with the (currently
hypothetical) module that should be in place before other modules are
started.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: It is quite easy to hang fvwm with this command, even if a
timeout is given. Be extra careful choosing the string to wait for.
Although all modules in the fvwm distribution send back the "NOP
FINISHED STARTUP" string once they have properly started up, this may
not be the case for third party modules. Moreover, you can try to
escape from a locked <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command by using the key
sequence</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(see the <strong>EscapeFunc</strong>).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ModuleTimeout</strong> <em>timeout</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies how many seconds fvwm waits for a module to respond. If the
module does not respond within the time limit then fvwm kills it.
<em>timeout</em> must be greater than zero, or it is reset to the default
value of 30 seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>SendToModule</strong> <em>modulename</em> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required) to all modules, whose
alias or name matching <em>modulename</em>, which may contain wildcards. This

these strings though. Can be used for module to module communication,

<h3 id="_colorsets">Colorsets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Colorsets are a powerful method to control colors. Colorsets create
appearance resources that are shared by fvwm and its modules. When a
colorset is modified all parts of fvwm react to that change. A colorset
includes a foreground color, background color, shadow and highlight
color (often based on the background color), background face (this
includes images and all kinds of gradients). There is a way to render
background face and specify other color operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Colorset</strong> <em>num</em> [<em>options</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates or modifies colorset <em>num</em>. Colorsets are identified by this
number. The number can start at zero and can be a very large number.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Warning: The highest colorset number used determines memory
consumption. Thus, if you define 'Colorset 100000', the memory for
100001 colorsets is used. Keep your colorset numbers as small as
possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By convention, colorsets are numbered like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre># 0 = Default colors
# 1 = Inactive windows
# 2 = Active windows
# 3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background
# 4 = Active menu entry
# 5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used)
# 6 = module foreground and background
# 7 = hilight colors</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need to have more colors and do not want to reinvent the wheel,
you may use the convention used in fvwm-themes, it defines the meaning
of the first 40 colorsets for nearly all purposes:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets" class="bare">http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each colorset has four colors, an optional pixmap and an optional
shape mask. The four colors are used by modules as the foreground,
background, highlight and shadow colors. When a colorset is created it
defaults to a foreground of black and background of gray. The
background and foreground are marked as "average" and "contrast" (see
later) so that just specifying a pixmap or gradient gives sensible
results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>options</em> is a comma separated list containing some of the keywords:
fg, Fore, Foreground, bg, Back, Background, hi, Hilite, Hilight, sh,
Shade, Shadow, fgsh, Pixmap, TiledPixmap, AspectPixmap, Transparent,
RootTransparent, Shape, TiledShape, AspectShape, NoShape, ?Gradient,
Tint, fgTint, bgTint, Alpha, fgAlpha, Dither, NoDither, IconTint,
IconAlpha, Plain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fg</em>, <em>Fore</em> and <em>Foreground</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the foreground color. The special name <em>Contrast</em> may be used to
select a color that contrasts well with the background color. To reset
the foreground color to the default value you can simply omit the
color name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>bg</em>, <em>Back</em> and <em>Background</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the background color. It also sets the highlight and shadow colors to
values that give a 3d effect unless these have been explicitly set
with the options below. The special name <em>Average</em> may be used to
select a color that is the average color of the pixmap. If the pixmap
is tinted with the <em>Tint</em> option, the tint is not taken in account in
the computation of the average color. You should use the <em>bgTint</em>
option to get the "real" average color. The background color is reset
to the default value if the color name is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>hi</em>, <em>Hilite</em> and <em>Hilight</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the highlight color. If the highlight color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>sh</em>, <em>Shade</em> and <em>Shadow</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the shadow color. If the shadow color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgsh</em> takes a color name as an argument and sets the color used by
the shadowing font effect. See the <strong>Font Shadow Effects</strong> section of
the fvwm man page. By default this color is computed from the
foreground and background colors. To switch back to the default the
color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Pixmap</em>, <em>TiledPixmap</em> and <em>AspectPixmap</em> take a file name as an
argument, search the <strong>ImagePath</strong> and use it as the background pixmap.
Any transparent parts are filled with the background color. Not
specifying a file name removes any existing image from the colorset.
<em>TiledPixmap</em> produces repeated copies of the image with no scaling,
<em>Pixmap</em> causes the image to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and <em>AspectPixmap</em> stretches to fit but retains
the image aspect ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Transparent</em> creates a transparent background pixmap. The pixmap is
used as a window background to achieve root transparency. For this you
should use the <em>ParentalRelativity</em> option to the <strong>Style</strong> command. A
subsequent root background change may be detected or not, this depends
on the program used to set the background. If you use <strong>fvwm-root</strong>,
<strong>xsetbg</strong> (xli), <strong>FvwmBacker</strong> with solid or colorset colors or a recent
version of <strong>Esetroot</strong> (&gt;= 9.2) a background change is detected. If
background changes are not detected (e.g., if you use <strong>xv</strong> or
<strong>xsetroot</strong>) you can force detection by using the <strong>-d</strong> option of
fvwm-root:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xv -root -quit mybg.png; fvwm-root -d</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the way X implements transparency no guarantees can be made
that the desired effect can be achieved. The application may even
crash. If you experience any problems with this option, do not use it.</p>

the <em>ResizeOpaque</em> <strong>Style</strong> option) as well as setting the
<em>WindowShadeShrinks</em> style may help. The transparency achieved with
<em>Transparent</em> depends on whether the colorset is applied to the
foreground or the background of a window. In the second case the
transparency is relative to the parent window of the window on which
the colorset is defined. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Colorset 12 VGradient 200 grey30 grey60
Colorset 17 Transparent
*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>gives an IconMan with a vertical grey gradient background and the
buttons use the background (by transparency). To obtain a (root)
transparent IconMan:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Colorset 12 Transparent
Colorset 17 Transparent
Colorset 18 Transparent
Colorset 19 Transparent

*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17
*FvwmIconMan: FocusColorset 18
*FvwmIconMan: IconColorset  19</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Colorset IconMan option defines the IconMan window background, but
the PlainColorset and the FocusColorset are drawn on the foreground.
So, the transparency of the IconMan buttons is achieved by drawing
nothing. Now if this IconMan is swallowed in an FvwmButtons as:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmButtons:(Colorset 10, Swallow "FvwmIconMan" 'FvwmIconMan')</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then, <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> becomes a child of <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> and it is
transparent relative to <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>. So, in this case <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>
uses Colorset 10 as background. If you want root transparency use the
<em>RootTransparent</em> option. <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>, and
<strong>FvwmIdent</strong>, are relatively simple. There is one main colorset option
which defines the background of the window and the other colorsets (if
any) are drawn on the foreground. The case of <strong>FvwmProxy</strong> is simpler,
the two colorsets refer to the window backgrounds. <strong>FvwmPager</strong> is more
complicated as almost everything in the pager are windows with some
parental relations (the mini windows are the child and the desktops
are the parents and all this is complicated by the hilighted page).
So, the colorsets apply to the background of these windows. You should
experiment. For <strong>FvwmForm</strong> and <strong>FvwmScript</strong> the situation is similar.
There is a main window (a child of the root window) which corresponds
to the main colorset and most of the widgets are windows which are
children of the main window. <em>Tint</em> may work or not with the
<em>Transparent</em> option. When the colorset is drawn on the foreground
<em>Tint</em> should work. In some cases, tinting may be very slow. Tinting
may work with fvwm menu (without animation). Tinting may work better
if your X server has backing store enabled (try xdpyinfo to see if
this the case). There is a chance that the backing store support of
your X server does not work well with the terrible hack used to Tint
the ParentRelative Pixmap. So, to get tinted root transparency it is
more safe to use the <em>RootTransparent</em> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RootTransparent</em> [ <em>buffer</em> ] creates a root transparent background.
To make this option work, you must use an <strong>Esetroot</strong> compatible
program, fvwm-root with the --retain-pixmap option or <strong>FvwmBacker</strong>
with the RetainPixmap option (and colorset or solid backgrounds). The
<em>buffer</em> keyword is useful only when the <em>Tint</em> option is used too.
This speeds up creation of windows which use the colorset (useful for
fvwm menus) at the cost of memory usage. It also speeds up opaque move
and resize which can be unacceptably slow without <em>buffer</em>. However,
this option may add a lot of memory to your X server (depending on the
size of the image used to set the background). In summary, using
outline move and resize for modules which use such a colorset may be a
good idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Shape</em>, <em>TiledShape</em> and <em>AspectShape</em> take a file name as an
argument, search the <strong>ImagePath</strong> and use it as the shape bitmap.
<em>TiledShape</em> produces repeated copies of the bitmap with no scaling,
<em>Shape</em> causes the bitmap to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and <em>AspectShape</em> stretches to fit but retains
the bitmap aspect ratio. If the file is a pixmap in xpm format the
shape mask (all opaque pixels) of the pixmap is used. For png and svg
images, the shape mask is equivalent to all not completely transparent
pixels (alpha &gt; 0).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Warning</strong> Due to the way X11 implements shapes you cannot take back
making windows shaped. You may have to restart fvwm or the shaped
application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>?Gradient &#8230;&#8203;</em> creates a pixmap and stretches it to fit the window.
<em>?Gradient</em> may be one of <em>HGradient</em>, <em>VGradient</em>, <em>DGradient</em>,
<em>BGradient</em>, <em>SGradient</em>, <em>CGradient</em>, <em>RGradient</em> or <em>YGradient</em>. The
gradient types are as follows: H is horizontal; V is vertical; D is
diagonal from top left to bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from
bottom left to top right; S is concentric squares; C is concentric
circles; R is a radar like pattern and Y is a Yin Yang style (but
without the dots). Please refer to the <strong>Color Gradients</strong> section for
the syntax of gradients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Tint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or <em>?Gradient</em> to be
tinted with the specified color using the percentage. If the image is
transparent <em>Tint</em> tints only the image part. Unfortunately, a
colorset background specified using the <em>Transparent</em> option can give
strange results. See the <em>Transparent</em> option for details. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using <em>fg</em> to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. With no arguments this option
removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>bgTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using <em>bg</em> to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. If the <em>sh</em> and <em>hi</em> colors are
not specified, they are recomputed from the tinted bg color. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Alpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It causes
fvwm to merge the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or <em>?Gradient</em> with
the <em>bg</em> color using the percentage. If the percentage is 0 the image
is hidden and if it is 100 the image is displayed as usual (no merge).
The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgAlpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the text and the colorset background using the
percentage. If the percentage is 0 the text is hidden and if it is 100
the text is displayed as usual (no merge). This option has an effect
only with fonts loaded by Xft, see the <strong>Font Names and Font Loading</strong>
section. The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Dither</em> causes fvwm to dither the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or
<em>?Gradient.</em> This is useful only with displays with depth less than or
equal to 16 (i.e., on displays which can only display less than 65537
colors at once). The dithering effect lets you simulate having more
colors available that you actually have. <em>NoDither</em> causes fvwm to do
not dither the images. <em>Dither</em> is the default if the depth is less
than or equal to 8 (a screen with 256 colors or less). In depth 15
(32768 colors) and 16 (65536 colors), the default is <em>NoDither</em>,
however this effect can be useful with images which contain a lot of
close colors. For example a fine gradient looks more smooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm or a module to tint the "icons" which are rendered
into the colorset background with the specified color using a
percentage. Here "icons" means, fvwm Icons, fvwm menu icons, MiniIcons
which represent applications in various modules, images loaded by
modules (e.g., images specified by the <em>Icon</em> <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> button
option) &#8230;&#8203;etc. With no arguments this option removes the icon tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconAlpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the "icons" which are rendered into the colorset
background using this percentage. The default is 100 and it is
restored if no argument is given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Note</em>: It is equivalent to use "Tint a_color rate" and "Alpha a" if a
= 100 and the bg color is a_color. This equivalence does not hold for
IconAlpha and IconTint as the background can be an image or a gradient
(and not a uniform color background). However, in some cases you can
achieve (almost) the same effect by using IconTint in the place of
IconAlpha. This is preferable as, in general, IconAlpha generates more
redrawing than IconTint.</p>

<p><em>NoShape</em> removes the shape mask from the colorset while <em>Plain</em>
removes the background pixmap or gradient.</p>

<p>A color gradient is a background that changes its color gradually from
one hue to a different one. Color gradients can be used by various
commands and modules of fvwm. There are eight types of gradients:
<strong>HGradient</strong> is a horizontal gradient, <strong>VGradient</strong> is vertical,
<strong>DGradient</strong> is diagonal from top left to bottom right, <strong>BGradient</strong> is
backwards diagonal from bottom left to top right, <strong>SGradient</strong> is
concentric squares, <strong>CGradient</strong> is concentric circles, <strong>RGradient</strong> is
a radar like pattern and <strong>YGradient</strong> is a Yin Yang style (but without
the dots).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The color gradient syntax has two forms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>?Gradient</strong> <em>colors</em> <em>start-color</em> <em>end-color</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form specifies a linear gradient. The arguments denote the total
number of <em>colors</em> to allocate (between 2 and 1000), the initial color
and the final color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>TitleStyle VGradient 20 rgb:b8/ce/bc rgb:5b/85/d0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>?Gradient</strong> <em>colors</em> <em>segments</em> <em>color</em> <em>length</em> <em>color</em> [<em>length</em>
<em>color</em>] &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second form specifies a nonlinear gradient. The arguments are: the
total number of <em>colors</em> to allocate (between 2 and 1000), then the
number of <em>segments</em>. For each segment, specify the starting <em>color</em>,
a relative <em>length</em>, then the ending color. Each subsequent segment
begins with the second color of the last segment. The lengths may be
any non-negative integers. The length of one segment divided by the
sum of all segments lengths is the fraction of the colors that are
used for the segment.</p>

<div class="literalblock highlight">
