<p>works exactly like the <strong>Style</strong> command, but accepts only the focus
policy related styles beginning with "FP". The prefix can be removed,
but at the cost of a little bit of time. <strong>FocusStyle</strong> is meant to make
the configuration file more readable. Example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

<dd>
<p>deletes the style named <em>style</em>. The changes take effect immediately.
Note that <em>style</em> is not a wild-carded search string, but rather a
case-sensitive string that should exactly match the original <strong>Style</strong>
command.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Destroying style "*" can be done, but isn&#8217;t really to be recommended.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>DestroyStyle Application*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This removes all settings for the style named "Application*", NOT all

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>UpdateStyles</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>All pending updates of all windows' styles and looks are applied

<p>The <strong>Style</strong> command is used to set attributes of a window to values
other than the default or to set the window manager default styles.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>stylename</em> can be a window&#8217;s name, class, visible name, or resource
string. It may contain the wildcards '<strong>' and '?', which are matched in
the usual Unix filename manner. Multiple style options in a single
*Style</strong> command are read from left to right as if they were issued one
after each other in separate commands. A given style always overrides
all conflicting styles that have been issued earlier (or further left
on the same style line).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: windows that have no name (WM_NAME) are given a name of
"Untitled", and windows that do not have a class (WM_CLASS, res_class)

<p>In the above list some options are listed as
style-option/opposite-style-option. The opposite-style-option for
entries that have them describes the fvwm default behavior and can be
used if you want to change the fvwm default behavior.</p>

<div class="dlist">

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Focus policy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><em>ClickToFocus</em> instructs fvwm to give the focus to a window when it
is clicked in. The default <em>MouseFocus</em> (or its alias
<em>FocusFollowsMouse</em>) tells fvwm to give a window the focus as soon
as the pointer enters the window, and take it away when the pointer
leaves the window. <em>SloppyFocus</em> is similar, but doesn&#8217;t give up the
focus if the pointer leaves the window to pass over the root window
or a ClickToFocus window (unless you click on it, that is), which
makes it possible to move the mouse out of the way without losing
focus. A window with the style <em>NeverFocus</em> never receives the
focus. This is useful for modules like <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>. for example.
Note: Once any of the "FP&#8230;&#8203;" styles has been used, the defaults
that come with the basic focus policies are not restored when the
latter are used again. For example, once !FPGrabFocus has been used,
using ClickToFocus does not restore FPGrabFocus.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The focus model can be augmented with several additional options. In
fvwm-2.5.3 and later, there are a large number of advanced options
beginning with "FP" or "!FP". These options shall replace the older
options one day and are described first. Using any of these new
options may limit compatibility with older releases. In general,
options beginning with "FP" turn a feature on, while those beginning
with "!FP" turn it off.</p>

<p>With <em>FPEnterToFocus</em>, when the pointer enters a window it receives

<p>The <em>FPFocusByProgram</em> style allows windows to take the focus
themselves.</p>

<p>The !<em>FPFocusByFunction</em> style forbids that a window receives the
focus via the <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>FlipFocus</strong> commands.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FPFocusByFunctionWarpPointer</em> style controls if the pointer is
warped to a selected window when the <strong>Focus</strong> command is used.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FPLenient</em> allows focus on windows that do not want it, like
<strong>FvwmPager</strong> or xclock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FPFocusClickButtons</em> style takes a list of mouse buttons that
can be clicked to focus or raise a window when the appropriate style
is used. The default is to use the first three buttons ("123").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FPFocusClickModifiers</em> style takes a list of modifier keys just
like the <strong>Key</strong> command. The exact combination of modifier keys must
be pressed for the click to focus or raise a window to work. The
default is to use no modifiers ("N").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>FPPassFocusClick</em> style, the click that was used to focus
a window is passed to the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>FPAllowFocusClickFunction</em> style, the click that was used
to focus a window can also trigger a normal action that was bound to
the window with the <strong>Mouse</strong> command).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <em>FPIgnoreFocusClickMotion</em> style is used, clicking in a
window and then dragging the pointer with the button held down does
not count as the click to focus the window. Instead, the application
processes these events normally. This is useful to select text in a
terminal window with the mouse without raising the window. However,
mouse bindings on the client window are not guaranteed to work
anymore (see <strong>Mouse</strong> command). This style forces the initial click
to be passed to the application. The distance that the pointer must
be moved to trigger this is controlled by the <strong>MoveThreshold</strong>
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FPSortWindowlistByFocus</em> and !<em>FPSortWindowlistByFocus</em> styles
control whether the internal window list is sorted in the order the
windows were focused or in the order they were created. The latter
is the default for <em>ClickToFocus</em> and <em>SloppyFocus</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Grabbing the focus when a new window is created</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New normal or transient windows with the <em>FPGrabFocus</em> or
<em>FPGrabFocusTransient</em> style automatically receive the focus when
they are created. <em>FPGrabFocus</em> is the default for windows with the
<em>ClickToFocus</em> style. Note that even if these styles are disabled,
the application may take the focus itself. Fvwm can not prevent
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>OverrideGrabFocus</em> style instructs fvwm to never take away the
focus from such a window via the <em>GrabFocus</em> or <em>GrabFocusTransient</em>
styles. This can be useful if you like to have transient windows
receive the focus immediately, for example in a web browser, but not
while you are working in a terminal window or a text processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above three styles are accompanied by <em>FPReleaseFocus</em>,
<em>FPReleaseFocusTransient</em> and <em>FPOverrideReleaseFocus</em>. These
control if the focus is returned to another window when the window
is closed. Otherwise no window or the window under the pointer
receives the focus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ClickToFocusPassesClickOff</em> and <em>ClickToFocusPassesClick</em> controls
whether a mouse click to focus a window is sent to the application
or not. Similarly,
<em>ClickToFocusRaisesOff</em>/<em>MouseFocusClickRaisesOff</em> and
<em>ClickToFocusRaises</em>/<em>MouseFocusClickRaises</em> control if the window
is raised (but depending on the focus model).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: in fvwm versions prior to 2.5.3, the "Click&#8230;&#8203;" options

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Window title</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>Title</em> and !Title options determine whether the window is
       decorated with a title-bar. By default all windows have a title-bar.
       <em>NoTitle</em> is equivalent to <em>!Title</em> but is deprecated.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Windows with the <em>TitleAtBottom</em>, <em>TitleAtLeft</em> or <em>TitleAtRight</em>
style have a title-bar below, to the left or to the right of the
window instead of above as usual. The <em>TitleAtTop</em> style restores
the default placement. Even if the window has the <em>!Title</em> style
set, this affects the <strong>WindowShade</strong> command. Please check the
<strong>WindowShade</strong> command for interactions between that command and
these styles. Titles on the left or right side of the windows are
augmented by the following styles:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, the text in titles on the left side of a window is rotated
counterclockwise by 90 degrees from the normal upright position and
90 degrees clockwise for titles on the right side. It can also be
rotated in the opposite directions with <em>LeftTitleRotatedCW</em> if
<em>TitleAtLeft</em> is used, and with <em>RightTitleRotatedCCW</em> if
<em>TitleAtRight</em> is used. The defaults can be restored with
<em>LeftTitleRotatedCCW</em> and <em>RightTitleRotatedCW</em>. A normal horizontal
text may be rotated as well with <em>TopTitleRotated</em> if <em>TitleAtTop</em>
is used, and with <em>BottomTitleRotated</em> if <em>TitleAtBottom</em> is used.
The defaults can be restored with <em>TopTitleNotRotated</em> and
<em>BottomTitleNotRotated</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default the title bar decoration defined using the <strong>TitleStyle</strong>
command is rotated following the title text rotation (see the
previous paragraph). This can be disabled by using the
!<em>UseTitleDecorRotation</em> style. <em>UseTitleDecorRotation</em> reverts back
to the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>StippledTitle</em> style, titles are drawn with the same
effect that is usually reserved for windows with the <em>Sticky</em>,
<em>StickyAcrossPages</em> or <em>StickyAcrossDesks</em> style. <em>!StippledTitle</em>
reverts back to normal titles. <em>StippledTitleOff</em> is equivalent to
<em>!StippledTitle</em> but is deprecated.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Colorset</strong> takes the colorset number as its sole argument and
overrides the colors set by <em>Color</em>. Instead, the corresponding
colors from the given colorset are used. Note that all other
features of a colorset are not used. Use the <strong>Colorset</strong> decoration
style in the <strong>TitleStyle</strong> and <em>ButtonStyle</em> command for that. To
stop using the colorset, the colorset number is omitted.</p>

<p><em>IconBackgroundColorset</em> takes the colorset number as its sole

default the icon picture is not drawn onto a background image. To
restore the default, the argument is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconTitleRelief</em> takes one numeric argument that may be between -50

around the icon title. With negative values the icon title gets a
pressed in look. The default is 2 and it is restored if the argument
is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconBackgroundRelief</em> takes one numeric argument that may be
between -50 and +50 pixels and defines the thickness of the 3D
relief drawn around the icon picture background (if any). With
negative values the icon background gets a pressed in look. The
default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconBackgroundPadding</em> takes one numeric argument that may be
between 0 and 50 pixels and defines the amount of free space between
the relief of the icon background picture (if any) and the icon
picture. The default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is
omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Font</em> and <em>IconFont</em> options take the name of a font as their

</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox geometry</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where <em>l</em> is the left coordinate, <em>t</em> is the top, <em>r</em> is right and
<em>b</em> is bottom. Negative coordinates indicate distance from the right
or bottom of the screen. If the first argument is the word <em>screen</em>,
the <em>scr-spec</em> argument specifies the RandR screen on which the
IconBox is defined ´or the additional 'w' for the screen where the
window center is located. This is only useful with multiple screens.
The "l t r b" specification is more flexible than an X11 geometry.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox -80 240 -1 -1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>defines a box that is 80 pixels wide from the right edge, 240 pixels
down from the top, and continues to the bottom of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps it is easier to use is an X11 geometry string though:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox 1000x70-1-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places an 1000 by 70 pixel icon box on the bottom of the screen
starting in the lower right hand corner of the screen. One way to
figure out a geometry like this is to use a window that resizes in
pixel increments, for example, xv. Then resize and place the xv
window where you want the iconbox. Then use FvwmIdent to read the
windows geometry. The icon box is a region of the screen where fvwm
attempts to put icons for any matching window, as long as they do
not overlap other icons. Multiple icon boxes can be defined as
overflow areas. When the first icon box is full, the second one is
filled. All the icon boxes for one style must be defined in one
<strong>Style</strong> command. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * IconBox -80 240 -1 -1, \
  IconBox 1000x70-1-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Style command with the IconBox option replaces any icon box
defined previously by another Style command for the same style.
That&#8217;s why the backslash in the previous example is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The geometry for the icon box command takes the additional
screen specifier "@w" in case RandR is used. This designates the
screen where the window center is located. The additional screen
specifier is not allowed anywhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you never define an icon box, or you fill all the icon boxes,
fvwm has a default icon box that covers the screen, it fills top to
bottom, then left to right, and has an 80x80 pixel grid. To disable
all but the default icon box you can use IconBox without arguments
in a separate <strong>Style</strong> command. To disable all icon boxes including
the default icon box, the argument "none" can be specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hint: You can auto arrange your icons in the icon box with a simple
fvwm function. Put the "DeiconifyAndRearrange" function below in
your configuration file:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange
 + C Iconify off
 + C All (CurrentPage, Iconic) PlaceAgain Icon</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then replace all places where you call the <strong>Iconify</strong> command to
de-iconify an icon with a call to the new function. For example
replace</p>

passed to <em>IconSize,</em> <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> represent the minimum
size of an icon, and <em>maxwidth</em> and <em>maxheight</em> represent the
maximum size of an icon. Icon images that are smaller than the
minimum size are padded. Icon images that are bigger than the
maximum size are clipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If only two arguments are passed to <em>IconSize,</em> <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>
represent the absolute size of an icon. Icons covered by this style
are padded or clipped to achieve the given size.</p>

<p><em>MiniIcon</em> specifies a pixmap to use as the miniature icon for the
window. This miniature icon can be drawn in a title-bar button (see
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong>), and can be used by various fvwm modules (<strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>
and <strong>FvwmPager</strong>). It takes the name of a pixmap as an argument.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>WindowShadeShrinks</em> and <em>WindowShadeScrolls</em> control if the contents
of a window that is being shaded with the <strong>WindowShade</strong> command are
scrolled (default) or if they stay in place. The shrinking mode is a
bit faster</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>WindowShadeSteps</em> option selects the number of steps for
animation when shading a window with <strong>WindowShade</strong>. It takes one
number as its argument. If the number has a trailing '<em>p</em>' it sets the
number of pixels to use as the step size instead of a fixed number of
steps. 0 disables the animation. This happens too if the argument is
omitted or invalid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>WindowShade</strong> command has two modes of operation: busy and lazy
shading. Busy shading can be 50% slower than lazy shading, but the
latter can look strange under some conditions, for example, if the
window borders, buttons or the title are filled with a tiled pixmap.
Also, the window handles are not drawn in lazy mode and the border
relief may only be drawn partially right before the window reaches the
shaded state or tight after leaves the unshaded state. By default,
fvwm uses lazy mode if there are no bad visual effects (not counting
the window handles) and busy mode otherwise. Use the
<em>WindowShadeAlwaysLazy or WindowShadeBusy</em> to force using the lazy or
busy mode. The default setting is restored with <em>WindowShadeLazy</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ResizeOpaque</em> instructs fvwm to resize the corresponding windows with
their contents visible instead of using an outline. Since this causes
the application to redraw frequently it can be quite slow and make the
window flicker excessively, depending on the amount of graphics the
application redraws. The <em>ResizeOutline</em> style (default) negates the
<em>ResizeOpaque</em> style. Many applications do not like their windows
being resized opaque, e.g. XEmacs, Netscape or terminals with a pixmap
background. If you do not like the result, do not use the
<em>ResizeOpaque</em> style for these windows. To exempt certain windows from
opaque resizing you could use these lines in your configuration file:</p>

<p>Windows that have been marked as <em>Sticky</em> or <em>StickyAcrossDesks</em> or

<p><em>FixedPPosition</em> and <em>FixedPSize</em> make fvwm ignore attempts of the

use the <em>VariablePPosition</em> or <em>VariablePSize</em> style. These styles may
sometimes affect the initial placement and dimensions of new windows
(depending on the application). If windows are created at strange
places, try either the <em>VariablePPosition</em> or <em>!UsePPosition</em> styles.
The <em>FixedPSize</em> style may screw up window dimensions for some
applications. Do Not use this style in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MoveByProgramMethod</em> affects how fvwm reacts to requests by the
application to move its windows. By default, fvwm tries to detect
which method to use, but it sometimes detects the wrong method. You
may come across a window that travels across the screen by a few
pixels when the application resizes it, moves to a screen border with
the frame decorations off screen, that remembers its position for the
next time it starts but appears in a slighly shifted position, or that
attepmts to become full screen but has the. Try out both options,
<em>UseGravity</em> and <em>IgnoreGravity</em> on the window (and that window only)
and see if that helps. By default, fvwm uses the <em>AutoDetect</em> method.
Once the method was detected, it is never changed again. As long as
fvwm can not detect the proper method, it uses <em>IgnoreGravity</em>. To
force fvwm to retry the detection, use one of the other two options
first and then use <em>AutoDetect</em> again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: This option was introduced to alleviate a problem with the ICCCM
specification. The ICCCM clearly states that the <em>UseGravity</em> option
should be used, but traditionally applications ignored this rule.</p>

<p><em>Closable</em> enables the functions <strong>Close</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong> and <strong>Destroy</strong> to be

<em>!Closable</em>, inhibits the window to be closed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Iconifiable</em> enables the function <strong>Iconify</strong> to be performed on the
windows. This is on by default. The opposite, <em>!Iconifiable</em>, inhibits
the window from being iconified.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>AllowMaximizeFixedSize</em> enables the function <strong>Maximize</strong> to be
performed on windows that are not resizable, unless maximization has
been disabled either using the style <em>!Maximizable</em> or through WM
hints. This is on by default. The opposite, <em>!AllowMaximizeFixedSize</em>,
inhibits all windows that are not resizable from being maximized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ResizeHintOverride</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program supplied
minimum and maximum size as well as the resize step size (the
character size in many applications). This can be handy for broken
applications that refuse to be resized. Do not use it if you do not
need it. The default (opposite) style is <em>NoResizeOverride</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]</em> Tells fvwm the
minimum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of
the total screen area. If the letter '<em>p</em>' is appended to either of the
values, the numbers are interpreted as pixels. If the letter '<em>c</em>' is
appended to either of the values, the numbers are in terms of the client
window&#8217;s size hints, which can be useful for windows such as terminals to
specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to deal with
windows that freak out if their window becomes too small. If you omit the
parameters or their values are invalid, both limits are set to 0 pixels
(which is the default value).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MaxWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]</em> Tells fvwm the
maximum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of

specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to force
large application windows to be fully visible. Neither <em>height</em> nor <em>width</em>
may be less than 100 pixels. If you omit the parameters or their values
are invalid, both limits are set to 32767 pixels (which is the default).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <em>IconifyWindowGroups</em> all windows in the same window group are
iconified and deiconified at once when any window in the group is
(de)iconified. The default is <em>IconifyWindowGroupsOff</em>, which disables
this behavior. Although a number of applications use the window group
hint, it is rarely used in a proper way, so it is probably best to use
<em>IconifyWindowGroups</em> only for selected applications.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>SnapAttraction</em> affects interactive window movement: If
during an interactive move the window or icon comes within <em>proximity</em>
pixels of another the window or icon, it is moved to make the borders
adjoin. The default of 0 means that no snapping happens. Calling this
command without arguments turns off snap attraction and restores the
default behavior. Please refer also to the <em>SnapGrid</em> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second argument optional and may be set to one of
the five following values: With <em>All</em> both icons and windows snap to
other windows and other icons. <em>SameType</em> lets windows snap only to
windows, and icons snap only to icons. With <em>Windows</em> windows snap
only to other windows. Similarly with <em>Icons</em> icons snap only to other
icons. With <em>None</em> no snapping takes place. This option can be useful
in conjunction with the thirs argument if you only want to snap
against the screen edges. The default behavior is <em>All</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third and last optional argument may be set to one of the four
following values:</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>With <em>Screen</em> the already snapping icons or windows, which is
controlled by the second argument, will snap now also to the screen
edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ScreenWindows</em> snaps only windows to the screen edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ScreenIcons</em> snaps only icons to the screen edges.</p>

<p><em>ScreenAll</em> snaps windows and icons to the screen edges.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>SnapGrid</em> defines an invisible grid on the screen. During
an interactive move a window or icon is positioned such that its
location (top left corner) is coincident with the nearest grid point.
The default <em>x-grid-size</em> and <em>y-grid-size</em> setting are both 1, which
is effectively no grid all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interactive move with both <em>SnapGrid</em> and <em>SnapAttraction</em> results
in the window being moved to be adjacent to the nearest window border
(if within snap proximity) or grid position. The window moves the
shortest distance possible to satisfy both <em>SnapGrid</em> and
<em>SnapAttraction</em>. Note that the x and y coordinates are not coupled.
For example, a window may snap to another window on the x axis while
snapping to a grid point on the y axis. Using this style without
arguments reinstates the default settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The styles <em>EdgeMoveDelay</em> and <em>EdgeResizeDelay</em> define how hard it
is to change the desktop viewport by moving or resizing a
window over the edge of the screen. The parameter tells how many
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm
moves the viewport. The command <strong>EdgeScroll</strong> determines how far the
viewport is scrolled. If -1 is given as the delay, page flipping is
disabled completely. The defaults are no delay for moving (0) and no
flipping for resizing (-1). Using these styles without any argument
restores the default settings. Note that, with</p>

current screen. See also <strong>EdgeThickness</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>EdgeMoveResistance</em> makes it easier to place a window
directly adjacent to a RandR screen&#8217;s edge. It takes one or two parameters.
The first parameter tells how many pixels over an outside edge of the
screen a window&#8217;s edge must move before it actually moves partially off
the screen. The optional second parameter does the same as the first, but
for inside edges (shared edge between two RandR monitors). If omitted,
there is no resistance between inside edges. Note that the center of the
window being moved determines the screen on which the window should be
kept. Both values are 0 (no resistance) by default. To restore the defaults,
the option <em>EdgeMoveResistance</em> can be used without any parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>InitialMapCommand</em> allows for any valid fvwm command or
function to run when the window is initially mapped by fvwm. Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style MyWindow StartsOnPage 0 0, InitialMapCommand Iconify</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would hence place the window called <em>MyWindow</em> on page 0 0 for
the current desk, and immediately run the <strong>Iconify</strong> command on that
window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that should <em>InitialMapCommand</em> be used as a global option for
all windows, but there is a need that some windows should not have
this command applied, then an action of <strong>Nop</strong> can be used on those
windows, as in the following example:</p>

<dd>
<p>Applications can place windows at a particular spot on the screen
either by window manager hints or a geometry specification. When they
do neither, then the window manager steps in to find a place for the
window. Fvwm knows several ways to deal with this situation. The
default is <em>TileCascadePlacement</em>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PositionPlacement</em> [<em>Center</em>|<em>UnderMouse</em>|<em>move-arguments</em>] When
used without an argument, new windows are placed in the top left
corner of the display. With the argument <em>Center</em>, all new window
appear at the center of the screen, and with <em>UnderMouse</em>, windows are
centered under the mouse pointer where possible. If the window is
unable to fit on the screen because the pointer is at the edge of the
screen, then the window is forced on-screen using this option. If any
other <em>move-arguments</em> are given, they are interpreted exactly as the
<strong>Move</strong> command does (with the exception that references to the current
window position do not work as the window has not been placed yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>CascadePlacement</em> automatically place new windows in a cascading
fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TileCascadePlacement</em> automatically places new windows in a smart
location - a location in which they do not overlap any other windows
on the screen. If no such position can be found <em>CascadePlacement</em> is
used as a fall-back method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TileManualPlacement</em> This is the same as <em>TileCascadePlacement</em>, but
uses <em>ManualPlacement</em> as the fall-back method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> automatically places new windows in a location
in which the overlapping area in pixels of other windows is minimized.
By default this placement policy tries to avoid overlapping icons and
windows on higher layers. This can be configured with the
<em>MinOverlapPlacementPenalties</em> style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinOverlapPercentPlacement</em> is similar to <em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> but
tries to minimize the overlapped percentages of other windows instead
of the overlapped area in pixels. This placement policy tries to avoid
covering other windows completely and tries even harder not to cover
small windows. This can be configured with the
<em>MinOverlapPlacementPenalties</em> and
<em>MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties</em> styles.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinOverlapPlacementPenalties</em> takes at most 6 positive or null

<p>To reset this style to the default values, prefix it with a '!'. This
style configures the <em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> and

affects normal windows, the <em>ontop</em> factor affects windows with a
greater layer than the window being placed, the <em>icon</em> factor affects
icons, the <em>sticky</em> factor affects sticky windows, the <em>below</em> factor
affects windows with a smaller layer than the window being placed, the
<em>strut</em> factor affects the complement of the EWMH working area if the
window being placed has the <em>EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea</em> style and
windows with an EWMH strut hint (i.e., a "please do not cover me"
hint) if the window being placed has the
<em>EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea</em> style. These factors represent
the amount of area that these types of windows (or area) are counted
as, when a new window is placed. For example, by default the area of
ontop windows is counted 5 times as much as normal windows. So
<em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> and <em>MinOverlapPercentPlacement</em> covers 5 times
as much area of another window before it will cover an ontop window.
To treat ontop windows the same as other windows, set this to 1. To
really, really avoid putting windows under ontop windows, set this to
a high value, say 1000. This style affects the window already mapped
and not the window which is currently placed. There is one exception
to this rule: in the case of the window being placed has the
<em>EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea</em> style the <em>strut</em> factor affects the

<p><em>ManualPlacement</em> (aka active placement). The user is required to
place every new window manually. The window only shows as a rubber
band until a place is selected manually. The window is placed when a
mouse button or any key except <em>Escape</em> is pressed. Escape aborts
manual placement which places the window in the top left corner of the
screen. If mouse button 2 is pressed during the initial placement of a
window (respectively <em>Shift</em> and mouse button 1 in case Mwm emulation
has been enabled with the <strong>Emulate</strong> command), the user is asked to
resize the window too.</p>

<p>It is possible to define buttons usable to place windows with the

<p><em>!UsePPosition</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
position (PPosition hint) when adding new windows. Using PPosition is
required for some applications, but if you do not have one of those
it&#8217;s a real headache. Many programs set PPosition to something
obnoxious like 0,0 (upper left corner). Note: <em>!UsePPosition</em> is
equivalent to the deprecated option <em>!UsePPosition</em></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>!UseUSPosition</em> works like <em>!UsePPosition</em> but applies suppresses
using the user specified position indicated by the program (USPosition
hint). It is generally a bad thing to override the user&#8217;s choice, but
some applications misuse the USPosition hint to force their windows to
a certain spot on the screen without the user&#8217;s consent. Note:
<em>!UseUSPosition</em> is equivalent to the deprecated option <em>!USPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NoUseTransientPPosition</em> and <em>UseTransientPPosition</em> work like

windows. Note: <em>!UseTransientPPosition</em> is equivalent to the
deprecated option <em>!TransientPPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NoUseIconPosition</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
icon position (IconPosition hint) when iconifying the window. Note:
<em>!UseIconPosition</em> is equivalent to the deprecated option
<em>!IconPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnDesk</em> takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on
which the window should be initially placed. Note that standard Xt
programs can also specify this via a resource (e.g. "-xrm '*Desk:
1'").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnPage</em> takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If one or three
arguments are given, the first (or only) argument is the desktop
number. If three arguments are given, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
identify the x,y page position on the virtual window. If two arguments
are given, they specify the page position, and indicate no desk
preference. If only one argument is given, <em>StartsOnPage</em> functions
exactly like <em>StartsOnDesk</em>. For those standard Xt programs which
understand this usage, the starting desk/page can also be specified
via a resource (e.g., "-xrm '*page: 1 0 2'"). <em>StartsOnPage</em> in
conjunction with <em>SkipMapping</em> is a useful technique when you want to
start an app on some other page and continue with what you were doing,
rather than waiting for it to appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnScreen</em> takes one argument. It must be a valid RandR name. A
new window is placed on the specified screen. The default is to place
windows on the screen that contains the mouse pointer at the time the
window is created. However, those windows which are not placed by fvwm
(i.e., those with a USPosition hint from a user specified geometry)
are normally placed in a position relative to all identified screens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnPageIncludesTransients</em> causes the <em>StartsOnPage</em> style to be
applied even for transient windows. This is not usually useful, since
transients are usually pop ups that you want to appear in your visible
viewport; but occasionally an application uses a transient for
something like a startup window that needs to be coerced into place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage</em> suppresses <em>StartsOnPage</em> or
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> placement in the event that both <em>ManualPlacement</em> and
<em>SkipMapping</em> are in effect when a window is created. This prevents
you from interactively placing a window and then wondering where it
disappeared to, because it got placed on a different desk or page.
<em>ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage</em> allows this to happen anyway. The
option has no effect if <em>SkipMapping</em> is not in effect, because fvwm
switches to the proper desk/page to perform interactive placement. The
default is <em>ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>;
<em>ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage</em> matches the way the old
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> style used to handle the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage</em> causes the initial capture (of an already
existing window) at startup to place the window according to the
<em>StartsOnPage</em> and <em>StartsOnScreen</em> desk, page and screen
specification. <em>CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em> causes fvwm to ignore
these settings (including <em>StartsOnDesk</em>) on initial capture. The
default is <em>CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage</em> causes a window to be placed according
to, or revert to, the <em>StartsOnPage</em> and <em>StartsOnScreen</em> desk, page
and screen specification on <strong>Restart</strong>. <em>RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>
causes fvwm to respect the current window position on <strong>Restart</strong>. The
default is <em>RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Layer</em> accepts one optional argument: a non-negative integer. This is
the layer the window is put in. If no argument is given, any
previously set value is deleted and the default layer is implied.</p>
</div>

<p><em>StaysOnTop</em> puts the window in the top layer. This layer can be
changed by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 6.</p>
</div>

<p><em>StaysPut</em> puts the window in the put layer. This layer can be changed
by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 4.</p>
</div>

<p><em>StaysOnBottom</em> puts the window in the bottom layer. This layer can be
changed by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsLowered</em> instructs fvwm to put the window initially at the
bottom of its layer rather than the default <em>StartsRaised</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartShaded</em> tells fvwm to shade the window. An optional direction
argument may be given, which can be one of "<em>North</em>", "<em>South</em>",
"<em>West</em>", "<em>East</em>", "<em>NorthWest</em>", "<em>NorthEast</em>", "<em>SouthWest</em>",
"<em>SouthEast</em>" or if no direction is given, the default is to shade
north.</p>

<p><em>SkipMapping</em> tells fvwm not to switch to the desk the window is on
when it gets mapped initially (useful with <em>StartsOnDesk</em> or
<em>StartsOnPage</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk</em> makes new windows that have the window group
hint set appear on the same desk as the other windows of the same
group. Since this behavior may be confusing, the default setting is
<em>ScatterWindowGroups</em>. The window group hint is ignored when placing
windows in this case.</p>

<p><em>DecorateTransient</em> causes transient windows, which are normally left
undecorated, to be given the usual fvwm decorations (title bar,
buttons, etc.). Note that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm
menus, are not managed by the window manager and still do not receive
decorations. <em>NakedTransient</em> (the default) causes transient windows
not to be given the standard decorations. You can only bind keys or
mouse buttons to the sides and the client part of an undecorated
window ('S' and ´W' contexts in bindings, see <strong>Mouse</strong> and <em>Key</em>
commands).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window with the <em>RaiseTransient</em> style that has transient windows
raises all its transients when it is raised. The <em>DontRaiseTransient</em>
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window with the <em>LowerTransient</em> style that has transient windows
lowers all its transients when it is lowered. The <em>DontLowerTransient</em>
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>StackTransientParent</em> style augments <em>RaiseTransient</em> and
<em>LowerTransient</em> styles. Raising a window with <em>StackTransientParent</em>
style transfers the raise action to the main window if the window
being raised is a transient and its main window has <em>RaiseTransient</em>
style; this effect makes raise on a transient act just like raise on
its main - the whole group is raised. Similar behavior holds for
lowering a whole group of transients when the main has
<em>LowerTransient</em> style. <em>DontStackTransientParent</em> turns this behavior
off. <em>(Dont)StackTransientParent</em> has no effect if <em>RaiseTransient</em>
and <em>LowerTransient</em> are not used.</p>

with the icon that is used by fvwm if the application does not provide
such hint (and if the icon used by fvwm is not an icon window).
<em>EWMHDonateMiniIcon</em> does the same thing for mini icons. This allows
compliant pager, taskbar, iconbox &#8230;&#8203;etc to display the same (mini)
icons as fvwm. Note that on some hardware (e.g., 8-bit displays) these
styles can slow down window mapping and that in general only one of

<p>The <em>BackingStore</em>, <em>BackingStoreOff</em> and <em>BackingStoreWindowDefault</em>
determine if the X server uses backing store for the window or not.
<em>BackingStore</em> means that the X server tries to keep the obscured
parts of a window in memory. This is usually slower if the client runs
on the same machine as the X server, but can be much faster if the
connection is slow (see also <em>SaveUnder</em> below). <em>BackingStoreOff</em>
disables backing store for the window. By default, fvwm does not
enable or disable backing store itself but leaves is as the window
requested it. To revert back to the application&#8217;s choice, use the

<p><em>Unmanaged</em> Windows with the <em>Unmanaged</em> style option are ignored by

<p><em>State</em> sets the initial value of one of the 32 user defined states
which are associated with each window. The state number ranges from 0
to 31 and must be given as an argument. The states have no meaning in
fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional commands like <strong>Next</strong> with
the <em>State</em> condition and manipulated with the <strong>State</strong> command.</p>

<p>Windows with the <em>WindowListSkip</em> styles do not appear in the menu
that is created with the <strong>WindowList</strong> command or the lists shown in
modules like <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>. In the modules, the style can usually be

question for further information. To disable this feature, use the
default style <em>WindowListHit</em>.</p>

<p>The styles <em>CirculateSkip</em> and <em>CirculateHit</em> control whether the
window is considered by conditional commands, for example <strong>Next</strong>,

conditional commands. However, the styles can be overridden explicitly
in the condition with the <em>CirculateHit</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em> or
<em>CirculateHitShaded</em> conditions, and some conditional commands,
e.g. <strong>Current</strong> and <em>All</em>, do this by default. The styles
<em>CirculateSkipIcon</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em>, <em>CirculateSkipShaded</em> and
<em>CirculateHitShaded</em> work like <em>CirculateSkip</em> and <em>CirculateHit</em> but
apply only to iconic or shaded windows. Note: if multiple &#8230;&#8203;Skip&#8230;&#8203;

window, the "Inactive" ones apply to all other windows. The "Up"
states apply to the non pressed buttons, the "Down" ones apply to
pressed buttons. The "Toggled" prefix refers to maximized, shaded or
sticky windows that have the corresponding <em>MwmDecor&#8230;&#8203;</em> button style
set. Additionally, the following shortcuts may be used: "<em>AllNormal</em>",
"<em>AllToggled</em>", "<em>AllActive</em>", "<em>AllInactive</em>", "<em>AllUp</em>",

for all buttons, which causes fvwm to draw any styles set with
<strong>TitleStyle</strong> before drawing the buttons. Finally, <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> is
used to place additional pixmaps for both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown"
states and a vector button style is drawn on top of all states.</p>

<p>for the "ActiveDown" and "InactiveDown" states: When a button is
pressed, the relief is inverted. Because of this, to obtain the raised
look in "ActiveDown" or "InactiveDown" states you must specify the
opposite of the desired relief (i.e. <em>Sunk</em> for "ActiveDown" or
"InactiveDown"). This behavior is consistent, but may seem confusing
at first. The same applies to the "Toggled" states.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Button styles are classified as non-destructive, partially
destructive, or fully destructive. Non-destructive styles do not
affect the image. Partially destructive styles can obscure some or all
parts of the underlying image (i.e. <em>Pixmap</em>). Fully destructive
styles obscure the entire underlying image (i.e. <em>Solid</em> or one of the
<em>gradient</em> styles). Thus, if stacking styles with <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> (or
<strong>AddTitleStyle</strong> for title-bars), use care in sequencing styles to
minimize redraw.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The available styles are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Simple</em>, <em>Default</em>, <em>Solid</em>, <em>Colorset</em>, <em>Vector</em>, <em>?Gradient</em>,
<em>Pixmap</em>, <em>AdjustedPixmap</em>, <em>ShrunkPixmap</em>, <em>StretchedPixmap</em>,
<em>TiledPixmap</em>, <em>MiniIcon</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The description of these styles and their arguments follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Simple</em> style does nothing. There are no arguments, and this
style is an example of a non-destructive button style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Default</em> style conditionally accepts one argument: a number which
specifies the default button number to load. If the style command
given is <strong>ButtonStyle</strong> or <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong>, the argument is optional
(if given, it overrides the current button). If a command other than
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong> or <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> is used, the number must be
specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Solid</em> style fills the button with a solid color. The relief
border color is not affected. The color is specified as a single
argument. This style is fully destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Colorset</em> <em>cs</em> [<em>alpha</em>] style fills the button with the Colorset
<em>cs</em>. The optional <em>alpha</em> argument is a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm to merge the colorset background onto the button using
this percentage. If the percentage is 0 the colorset background is
hidden and if it is 100 the colorset background is fully applied. The
default is 100. So, the destructiveness depends on the <em>alpha</em>
argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Vector</em> <em>num</em>
<em>X</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]x</strong><em>Y</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]@C &#8230;&#8203;</strong>
style draws a line pattern. Since this is a standard button style, the
keyword <em>Vector</em> is optional, <em>num</em> is a number of point
specifications of the form
<em>X</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]x</strong><em>Y</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]@C &#8230;&#8203;</strong> <em>X</em>
and <em>Y</em> are point coordinates inside the button, given in percents
(from 0 to 100). An optional absolute <em>offset</em> in pixels, can be given
as "+&lt;offset&gt;p" for a positive or "-&lt;offset&gt;p" for a negative offset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>C</em> specifies a line color (0 - the shadow color, 1 - the highlight
color, 2 - the background color, 3 - the foreground color, 4 - only
move the point, do not draw). The first point color is not used. You
can use up to 10000 points in a line pattern. This style is partially
destructive.</p>

<p>The <em>Pixmap</em> style displays a pixmap. A pixmap should be specified as
an argument. For example, the following would give button number 2 the
same pixmap for all 4 states (2 active and 2 inactive), and button
number 4 all different pixmaps.</p>

<p>The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative

style reverts to <em>Simple</em>. Flags specific to the <em>Pixmap</em> style are
<em>Left</em>, <em>Right</em>, <em>Top</em>, and <em>Bottom</em>. These can be used to justify the
pixmap (default is centered for both directions). Pixmap transparency
is used for the color "None." This style is partially destructive.</p>

buttons bound to complex functions, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p><em>MwmDecorMax</em> should be assigned to title-bar buttons which maximize

<p>Sets attributes for the title-bar. Justifications can be <em>Centered</em>,
<em>RightJustified</em> or <em>LeftJustified</em>. <em>Height</em> sets the title bar&#8217;s
height to an amount in pixels. <em>MinHeight</em> sets the minimal height in

<p>Sets the style for the title-bar. See also <strong>AddTitleStyle</strong> and
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong> <em>state</em> can be one of "<em>ActiveUp</em>", "<em>ActiveDown</em>",
"<em>InactiveUp</em>", or "<em>InactiveDown</em>". Shortcuts like "<em>Active</em>" and
"<em>Inactive</em>" are allowed. The states with the "Toggled" prefix are
allowed too, the title itself does not use "Toggled" states, but these
states are used for the buttons with <strong>ButtonStyle</strong> <em>UseTitleStyle</em>. If
<em>state</em> is omitted, then the <em>style</em> is added to every state. If
parentheses are placed around the <em>style</em> and <em>flags</em>, then multiple
state definitions can be given per line. <em>style</em> can be omitted so
that flags can be set while not destroying the current style.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a '!' is prefixed to any <em>flag</em>, its behavior is negated. Valid
flags for each state include <em>Raised</em>, <em>Flat</em> and <em>Sunk</em> (these are
mutually exclusive). The default is <em>Raised</em>. See the note in
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong> regarding the "<em>ActiveDown</em>" state. Examples:</p>

<p>This sets the "ActiveUp" state to a horizontal gradient, the
"ActiveDown" state to solid red, and the "Inactive" states to a tiled
wood pixmap. Finally, "ActiveUp" and "InactiveUp" are set to look
flat, while "ActiveDown" set to be sunk (the <em>Raised</em> flag for the
"ActiveDown" state causes it to appear sunk due to relief inversion),

of a transition section, <em>LeftEnd</em>, <em>LeftOfText</em>, <em>RightOfText</em> or
<em>RightEnd</em>, <em>AdjustedPixmap</em> only resize the pixmap in the "y"
direction. For the <em>Colorset</em> and <em>Solid</em> styles a width of the half
