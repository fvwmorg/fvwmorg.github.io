<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm is a window manager for X11 optimised for speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint and is extremely
customizable and extendible.  A large <em>virtual desktop</em> and
<em>multiple disjoint desktops</em> can be used separately or together.
The virtual desktop pretends that the video screen is really quite
large, and you can scroll around within the desktop.  The multiple
disjoint desktops pretend there are really several screens to work
at, but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm provides <em>keyboard accelerators</em> that allow one to perform practically
all window manager functions, including moving and resizing windows and
operating the menus, using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm does not distinguish between configuration and action commands.
Configuration commands typically set fonts, colors, menu contents, and
key and mouse function bindings, while action commands do things like
raising and lowering windows. Fvwm makes no such distinction and allows
anything to be changed at any time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_options">OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the command line options that are recognized by fvwm:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-i</strong> | <strong>--clientid</strong> <em>id</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-c</strong> | <strong>--cmd</strong> <em>config-command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>config-command</em> instead of '<strong>Read</strong> <em>config</em>' (or
'<strong>Read</strong> <em>.fvwm2rc</em>') as its initialization command. (Note that up to 10
<strong>-f</strong> and <strong>-c</strong> parameters can be given, and they are executed in the
order specified.)</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any module started by command line arguments is assumed to be a module
that sends back config commands. All command line modules have to quit
before fvwm proceeds on to the StartFunction and setting border
decorations and styles. There is a potential deadlock if you start a
module other than <strong>FvwmPerl</strong> but there is a timeout
so fvwm eventually gets going.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, starting the pager this way hangs fvwm until the timeout,
but the following should work well:</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>fvwm -c "AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPager"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-d</strong> | <strong>--display</strong> <em>displayname</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Manage the display called <em>displayname</em> instead of the name obtained
from the environment variable <em>$DISPLAY</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-f</strong> <em>config-file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to read <em>config-file</em> instead of <em>~/.fvwm/config</em> as its
initialization file. <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> can also be used to change location
of default user directory <em>~/.fvwm</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-o</strong> <em>logfile</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write log messages to <em>logfile</em>.  If <em>logfile</em> is '-', log to the
console.  (Does not turn on logging, see the <strong>-v</strong> option.)</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-h</strong> | <strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short usage description is printed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-r</strong> | <strong>--replace</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Try to take over from a previously running wm. This does not work unless
the other wm is ICCCM2 2.0 compliant.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-F</strong> | <strong>--restore</strong> <em>state-file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-V</strong> | <strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the version of fvwm to <em>stderr</em>. Also prints an information about
the compiled in features as stated at compiletime.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-C</strong> | <strong>--visual</strong> <em>visual-class</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>visual-class</em> for the window borders and menus.
<em>visual-class</em> can be "StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor",
"PseudoColor", "TrueColor" or "DirectColor".</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-I</strong> | <strong>--visualid</strong> <em>id</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>id</em> as the visual id for the window borders and
menus. <em>id</em> can be specified as N for decimal or 0xN for hexadecimal.
See man page of xdpyinfo for a list of supported visuals.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-l</strong> | <strong>--color-limit</strong> <em>limit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a <em>limit</em> on the colors used in image, gradient and possibly
simple colors used by fvwm. In fact, fvwm (and all the modules) uses a
palette with at most <em>limit</em> colors. This option is only useful with
screens that display 256 colors (or less) with a dynamic visual
(PseudoColor, GrayScale or DirectColor). The default depends on your X
server and how you run fvwm. In most case this default is reasonable.
The <strong>-l</strong> option should be used only if you encounter problems with
colors. By default, fvwm tries to detect large pre-allocated palettes.
If such a palette is detected fvwm uses it and a priori the <strong>-l</strong> must
not be used. Moreover, in this case the <strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-S</strong> options are
forced. Note that XFree-4.2 pre-allocates 244 colors (if you use a
driver with Render support) leaving only a few free colors. This may
lead to some color problems (and nothing can be done). XFree-4.3 or
better pre-allocate only 85 colors. If no pre-allocated palette is auto
detected the defaults are as follow:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display depth 8 (256 colors)</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>PseudoColor: 68 (4x4x4 color cube + 4 grey)
GrayScale: 64 regular grey
DirectColor: 32 (3x3x3 color cube + 5 grey)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display depth 4 (16 colors)</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>PseudoColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
GrayScale: 8 regular grey
DirectColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that if you use a private color map (i.e., fvwm is started with the
<strong>-C</strong> or the <strong>-I</strong> options), then other defaults are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now what to do if you encounter problems with colors? The first thing to
do is to check if you really cannot run your X server with depth 15, 16
or better. Check your X server documentation. Note that some hardware
can support two different depths on the same screen (typically depth 8
and depth 24). If depth 8 is the default, you can force fvwm to use the
best depth by using the <strong>-C</strong> option with <em>TrueColor</em> as argument. So now
we assume that you are forced to run in depth 8 with a dynamic visual
because your hardware/driver cannot do better or because you need to use
an application which needs to run under this mode (e.g., because this
application needs read-write colors). What it should be understand is
that you have only 256 colors and that all the applications which use
the default color map must share these colors. The main problem is that
there are applications which use a lot or even all the colors. If you
use such application you may have no more free colors and some
applications (which used only a few colors) may fail to start or are
unusable. There are three things that can be done (and fvwm does not
really play a particular role, all applications are concerned). The
first is to run the applications which waste your (default) color map
with a private color map. For example, run netscape with the -install
option, run KDE or QT applications with the --cmap option, use the <strong>-C</strong>
option for fvwm. The disadvantage of this method is that it is visually
disturbing (see the <strong>ColormapFocus</strong> command for a better control of the
color maps switching). The second method is to limit the number of
colors that the applications use. Again, some applications have options
to specify a given color limit. With fvwm you may try various values, 61
(a special "visual" palette), 56 (a 4x4x3 color cube plus 6 grey), 29 (a
3x3x3 color cube plus 2 grey), 10 or 9. Also, you may use the <strong>-L</strong>
option. However, limiting the number of colors is not the definitive
solution. The definitive solution is to try cause applications which use
a lot of colors use the same colors. This is a difficult task as there
are no formal standards for this goal. However, some toolkits as QT and
GTK use color cubes as palettes. So, the idea is to configure your
applications/toolkits to all use the same color cube. Moreover, you can
use the colors in this color cube in your X resources configuration
files and/or as arguments to colors options. Fvwm can use any color cube
of the form RxGxB with 2 &lt;= R &lt;= 6, R = G, R-1 =&lt; B &lt;= R and B &gt;= 2. To
get an RxGxB color cube give an argument to <strong>-l</strong> an integer c &gt;= R*G*B
and &lt; (R+1)<strong>(G+1)*B if B=R and &lt; R*G</strong>(B+1) if B &lt; R (and different from
61). If c &gt; R*G*B, then some grey may be added to the color cube. You
can use the <strong>PrintInfo</strong> <em>Colors</em> [<em>1</em>] command to get information on
your fvwm colors setting. In particular, this command prints the palette
used by fvwm in rgb format (the last integer gives the number of times
fvwm has allocated the colors).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-L</strong> | <strong>--strict-color-limit</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
causes fvwm to use its palette for all the colors. By default, the
palette is used only for images and gradients.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-P</strong> | <strong>--visual-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
this option causes fvwm to use a palette designed for limiting the
"visual" color distance between the points of the palette. Moreover, for
better color sharing, if possible colors with a name in the X rgb data
base are used for defining the colors (with the hope that applications
and images prefer to use named colors). If the <strong>-l</strong> option is not used
this palette has 61 colors. This palette is also automatically selected
if 61 or 9 is used as argument to the <strong>-l</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-A</strong> | <strong>--allocate-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to allocate all the colors of its palette at
start up for reserving these colors for future use. This option forces
the <strong>-static-palette</strong> option. By default, fvwm allocates (reserves) a
color in its palette only if it needs this color.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-S</strong> | <strong>--static-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to never free the colors in its palette. By
default, when fvwm does not need a color any more it frees this color so
that a new color can be used. This option may speed up image loading and
save a few bits of memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>--debug-stack-ring</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables stack ring debugging. This option is only intended for internal
debugging and should only be used by developers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-v</strong> | <strong>--verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables debug logging. Writes in append mode to fvwm log file, which is
~/.fvwm/fvwm3-output.log by default. See ENVIRONMENT section on how to
override this location on fvwm3 startup using <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> or
<em>$FVWM3_LOGFILE</em> .</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Logging can also be dynamically toggled on and off using signals:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>SIGUSR1 : used as a signal to restart Fvwm
SIGUSR2 : used as a signal to toggle opening/closing debug log file</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_anatomy_of_a_window">ANATOMY OF A WINDOW</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows. This border consists
of a bar on each side and a small L-shaped section on each corner. There
is an additional top bar called the title-bar which is used to display
the name of the window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar
buttons. The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively known as the
side-bars. The corner pieces are called the frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the built-in minimal configuration, dragging mouse button 1 in the
frame or side-bars begins a resize operation on the window. Dragging
mouse button 2 in the frame or side-bars begins a move operation. There
are raise/lower operations bound to a single clicking on borders.
Similarly for the window title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist. Their use is completely user
definable. One popular configuration uses one button on the left that is
used to bring up a list of window options and two buttons on the right
used to iconify and maximize the window. Another popular configuration
adds a close button to the right. The number of title-bar buttons used
depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them. See the <strong>Mouse</strong>
command.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_virtual_desktop">THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use them.
The screen is a viewport onto a <em>desktop</em> which may be larger than the
screen. Several distinct desktops can be accessed (concept: one desktop
for each project, or one desktop for each application, when view
applications are distinct). Since each desktop can be larger than the
physical screen, divided into m by n <em>pages</em> which are each the size of
the physical screen, windows which are larger than the screen or large
groups of related windows can easily be viewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The (m by n) size (i.e. number of pages) of the virtual desktops can be
changed any time, by using the <strong>DesktopSize</strong> command. All virtual
desktops must be (are) the same size. The total number of distinct
desktops does not need to be specified, but is limited to approximately
4 billion total. All windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in the
<strong>FvwmPager</strong>, a miniature view of the desktops. The pager is an accessory
program, called a module, which is not essential for the window manager
to operate. Windows may also be listed using the <strong>WindowList</strong> command or
the <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> module.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm keeps the windows on the desktop in a layered stacking order; a
window in a lower layer never obscures a window in a higher layer. The
layer of a window can be changed by using the <strong>Layer</strong> command. The
concept of layers is a generalization of the <em>StaysOnTop</em> flag of older
fvwm versions. The <em>StaysOnTop</em> and <em>StaysPut</em> <strong>Style</strong> options are now
implemented by putting the windows in suitable layers and the previously
missing <em>StaysOnBottom</em> <strong>Style</strong> option has been added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Sticky</em> windows are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
"Sticking to the screen&#8217;s glass". They always stay put on the screen.
This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiffs, so you only need
to run one such gadget and it always stays with you. Icons can also be
made to stick to the glass, if desired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport. That
is:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +0+0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>creates a window in the upper left hand corner of the visible portion of
the screen. It is permissible to specify geometries which place windows
on the virtual desktop, but off the screen. For example, if the visible
screen is 1000 by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the
current viewport is at the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
invoking:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +1000+1000</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places a window just off of the lower right hand corner of the screen.
It can be found by moving the mouse to the lower right hand corner of
the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view. A geometry specified
as something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry -5-5</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places the window&#8217;s lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower
right corner of the visible portion of the screen. Not all applications
support window geometries with negative offsets. Some applications place
the window&#8217;s upper right hand corner 5 pixels above and to the left of
the upper left hand corner of the screen; others may do just plain
bizarre things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a fvwm-specific extension to geometry strings which can also
enforce the geometry is relative to the given screen.  For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +0+0@n</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where 'n' can be one of a RandR monitor name, or an assigned monitor number.
For more details, see the RANDR SUPPORT section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desktop or page
other than the currently active one. The geometry technique mentioned
above (specifying x,y coordinates larger than the physical screen size),
however, suffers from the limitation of being interpreted relative to
the current viewport: the window may not consistently appear on a
specific page, unless you always invoke the application from the same
page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better way to place windows on a different page, screen or desk from
the currently mapped viewport is to use the <em>StartsOnPage</em> or
<em>StartsOnScreen</em> style specification (the successors to the older
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> style) in your <em>config</em> file. The placement is
consistent: it does not depend on your current location on the virtual
desktop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications that understand standard Xt command line arguments and
X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to specify the
start-up desk or page on the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>starts an xterm on desk number 1;</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>starts an xterm two pages to the right and one down from the upper left
hand page of desk number 3. Not all applications understand the use of
these options, however. You could achieve the same results with the
following lines in your <em>.Xdefaults</em> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>XTerm*Desk: 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>XTerm*Page: 3 2 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_randr_multi_screen_support">RANDR MULTI-SCREEN SUPPORT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm best supports multiple screens using the RandR X11 protocol. If
fvwm isn&#8217;t built with the RandR protocol then the multi screen support

recommended to use 'EdgeScroll 0 0' on multi-screen displays to avoid
changing pages when moving the mouse between screens.</p>

<p>When Fvwm detects monitors, it adds them to a tree with a defined order, and
each monitor is assigned a number.  That order is top-down, left-to-right, so
for example, the following diagram illustrates a monitor layout and their
assigned number.</p>

running. <em>$DISPLAY</em> may be <em>unix:0.0</em> or <em>:0.0</em>, which doesn&#8217;t work too
well when passed through ssh to another machine, so <em>$HOSTDISPLAY</em> is
set to a network-ready description of the display. <em>$HOSTDISPLAY</em> always

what you are doing. It is usually important to start applications or
modules after the entire config is read, because it contains styles or
module configurations which can affect window appearance and
functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard way to start applications or modules on fvwm&#8217;s start up is
to add them to an initialization function (usually <strong>StartFunction</strong> or
<strong>InitFunction</strong>). This way they are only started after fvwm finishes to
read and execute <em>config</em> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm has three special functions for initialization: <strong>StartFunction</strong>,
which is executed on startups and restarts; <strong>InitFunction</strong> and
<strong>RestartFunction</strong>, which are executed during initialization and restarts
(respectively) just after StartFunction. These functions may be
customized in a user&#8217;s <em>config</em> file using the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command
(described later) to start up modules, xterms, or whatever you&#8217;d like to
have started by fvwm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm has also a special exit function: <strong>ExitFunction</strong>, executed when
exiting or restarting before actually quitting. It could be used to
explicitly kill modules, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If fvwm is run under a session manager, functions <strong>SessionInitFunction</strong>
and <strong>SessionRestartFunction</strong> are executed instead of InitFunction and
RestartFunction. This helps to define the user&#8217;s <em>config</em> file to be
good for both running under a session manager and without it. Generally
it is a bad idea to start xterms or other applications in "Session*"
functions. Also someone can decide to start different modules while
running under a session manager or not. For the similar purposes
<strong>SessionExitFunction</strong> is used instead of ExitFunction.</p>

<h2 id="_modules">MODULES</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process but
transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Users can write their own modules
to do any weird or bizarre manipulations without bloating or affecting
the integrity of fvwm itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm
and the module to communicate with. The pipes are already open for the
module when it starts and the file descriptors for the pipes are
provided as command line arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by use
of the <strong>Module</strong> command. Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task and exit. If the module is still
active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm closes the communication
pipes and waits to receive a SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it
has detected the pipe closure and has exited. If modules fail to detect
the pipe closure fvwm exits after approximately 30 seconds anyway. The
number of simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system&#8217;s maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between 60
and 256.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command engine. Commands
are formatted just as in the case of a mouse binding in the <em>config</em>
setup file. Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted, as in the
sample module <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="_icccm_compliance">ICCCM COMPLIANCE</h2>

<p>Fvwm attempts to be ICCCM 2.0 compliant. Check
<a href="http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/" class="bare">http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/</a> for more info. In addition, ICCCM
states that it should be possible for applications to receive any
keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut approach
used in fvwm and most other window managers. In particular you cannot
have the same keyboard shortcuts working with your fvwm and another fvwm
running within Xnest (a nested X server running in a window). The same
problem exists with mouse bindings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
Client accepts input or input focus: False</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window manager.
These windows can take the input focus by themselves, however. A number
of applications set this property, and yet expect the window manager to
give them the keyboard focus anyway, so fvwm provides a window style,
<em>Lenience</em>, which allows fvwm to overlook this ICCCM rule. Even with
this window style it is not guaranteed that the application accepts
focus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The differences between ICCCM 1.1 and 2.0 include the ability to take
over from a running ICCCM 2.0 compliant window manager; thus</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>fvwm; vi ~/.fvwm/config; fvwm -replace</pre>

<p>resembles the <strong>Restart</strong> command. It is not exactly the same, since
killing the previously running wm may terminate your X session, if the
wm was started as the last client in your <em>.Xclients</em> or <em>.Xsession</em>
file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further additions are support for client-side colormap installation (see
the ICCCM for details) and the urgency hint. Clients can set this hint
in the WM_HINTS property of their window and expect the window manager
to attract the user&#8217;s attention to the window. Fvwm has two re-definable
functions for this purpose, "UrgencyFunc" and "UrgencyDoneFunc", which
are executed when the flag is set/cleared. Their default definitions

for short) specification:
<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html" class="bare">https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html</a> and
some extensions of this specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This support is configurable with styles and commands. These styles and
commands have EWMH as the prefix (so you can find them easily in this
man page).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a new Context 'D' for the <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>PointerKey</strong>, <strong>Mouse</strong>
commands. This context is for desktop applications (such as kdesktop and
Nautilus desktop).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a compliant taskbar asks fvwm to activate a window (typically when
you click on a button which represents a window in such a taskbar), then
fvwm calls the complex function <strong>EWMHActivateWindowFunc</strong> which by
default is Iconify Off, Focus and Raise. You can redefine this function.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I Iconify Off
+ I Focus
+ I Raise

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>additionally warps the pointer to the center of the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EWMH specification introduces the notion of Working Area. Without
ewmh support the Working Area is the full visible screen (or all your
screens if you have a multi head setup with RandR). However, compliant
applications (such as a panel) can ask to reserve space at the edge of
the screen. If this is the case, the Working Area is your full visible
screen minus these reserved spaces. If a panel can be hidden by clicking
on a button the Working Area does not change (as you can unhide the
panel at any time), but the Dynamic Working Area is updated: the space
reserved by the panel is removed (and added again if you pop up the
panel). The Dynamic Working Area may be used when fvwm places or
maximizes a window. To know if an application reserves space you can
type "xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT" in a terminal and select the
application. If four numbers appear then these numbers define the
reserved space as explained in the <strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong> command.</p>

using the <strong>Read</strong> command, it is easy to read in new configuration files
as you go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lines beginning with '#' are ignored by fvwm. Lines starting with '*'
are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather than

newlines in a configuration file line can be quoted by preceding them
with a backslash. All lines linked in this fashion are treated as a
single line. The newline itself is ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and action
commands, so anything mentioned in the fvwm commands section can be
placed on a line by itself for fvwm to execute as it reads the
configuration file, or it can be placed as an executable command in a
menu or bound to a mouse button or a keyboard key. It is left as an

<p>A font name can be given as an extended XLFD. This is a comma separated
list of (simple) XLFD font names, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*,-*-courier-medium-r-normal--14-*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each simple font name is tried until a matching font with the locale
charset is found and if this fails each simple font name is tried
without constraint on the charset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More details on the XLFD can be found in the X manual page, the X
Logical Font Description Conventions document (called xlfd) and the
XLoadFont and XCreateFontSet manual pages. Some useful font utilities
are: xlsfonts, xfontsel, xfd and xset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have Xft support you can specify an Xft font name (description)
of a true type (or Type1) font prefixed by "xft:", for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>"xft:Luxi Mono"
"xft:Luxi Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso8859-1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "first" font which matches the description is loaded. This first
font depends on the XftConfig configuration file with Xft1 and on the
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf file with Xft2. One may read the Xft manual page
and the fontconfig man page with Xft2. The first string which follows
"xft:" is always considered as the family. With the second example Luxi
Mono is the Family (Other XFree TTF families: "Luxi Serif", "Luxi
Sans"), Medium is the Weight (other possible weights: Light, DemiBold,
Bold, Black), Roman is the slant or the style (other possibilities:
Regular, Oblique, Italic) size specifies the point size (for a pixel
size use pixelsize=), encoding allows for enforce a charset (iso8859-1
or iso10646-1 only; if no encoding is given the locale charset is
assumed). An important parameter is "minspace=bool" where bool is True
or False. If bool is False (the default?) Xft gives a greater font
height to fvwm than if bool is True. This may modify text placement,
icon and window title height, line spacing in menus and <strong>FvwmIdent</strong>,
button height in some fvwm modules &#8230;&#8203;etc. With a LCD monitor you may
try to add "rgba=mode" where mode is either rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr to
enable subpixel rendering. The best mode depends on the way your LCD
cells are arranged. You can pass other specifications in between ":", as
"foundry=foundry_name", "spacing=type" where type can be monospace,
proportional or charcell, "charwidth=integer", "charheight=integer" or
"antialias=bool" where bool is True or False. It seems that these
parameters are not always taken in account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To determine which Xft fonts are really loaded you can export
XFT_DEBUG=1 before starting fvwm and take a look to the error log. With
Xft2 you may use fc-list to list the available fonts. Anyway, Xft
support is experimental (from the X and the fvwm point of view) and the
quality of the rendering depends on number of parameters (the XFree and
the freetype versions and your video card(s)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After an Xft font name you can add after a ";" an XLFD font name (simple
or extended) as:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14;-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then, if either loading the Xft font fails or fvwm has no Xft support,
fvwm loads the font "-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal&#8212;&#8203;14-*". This allows
for writing portable configuration files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_font_and_string_encoding">Font and string encoding</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a font is loaded, fvwm finds its encoding (or charset) using its
name (the last two fields of the name). fvwm assumes that the strings
which are displayed with this font use this encoding (an exception is
that if an iso10646-1 font is loaded, then UTF-8 is assumed for string
encoding). In a normal situation, (i) a font is loaded by giving a font
name without specifying the encoding, (ii) the encoding of the loaded
font is the locale encoding, and then (iii) the strings in the fvwm
configuration files should use the locale encoding as well as the window
and icon name. With Xft the situation is bit different as Xft supports
only iso10646-1 and iso8859-1. If you do not specify one of these
encodings in the Xft font name, then fvwm does strings conversion using
(iii). Note that with multibyte fonts (and in particular with "CJK"
fonts) for good text rendering, the locale encoding should be the
charset of the font.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To override the previous rules, it is possible to specify the string
encoding in the beginning of a font description as follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=enc:_full_font_name_</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <em>enc</em> is an encoding supported by fvwm (usually font name charset
plus some unicode encodings: UTF-8, USC-2, USC-4 and UTF-16).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you may use an iso8859-1 locale charset and have an
<strong>FvwmForm</strong> in Russian using koi8-r encoding. In this case, you just have
to ask <strong>FvwmForm</strong> to load a koi8-r font by specifying the encoding in
the font name. With a multibyte language, (as multibyte font works well
only if the locale encoding is the charset of the font), you should use
an iso10646-1 font:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>"StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if your <strong>FvwmForm</strong> configuration uses jisx0208.1983-0 encoding. Another
possibility is to use UTF-8 encoding for your <strong>FvwmForm</strong> configuration
and use an iso10646-1 font:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</pre>

<div class="literalblock highlight">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>or equivalently</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>"xft:Bitstream Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646-1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general iso10646-1 fonts together with UTF-8 string encoding allows
the display of any characters in a given menu, <strong>FvwmForm</strong> etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More and more, unicode is used and text files use UTF-8 encoding.
However, in practice the characters used range over your locale charset.
For saving memory (an iso10646-1 font may have a very large number of
characters) or because you have a pretty font without an iso10646-1 charset,
you can specify the string encoding to be UTF-8 and use a font in the locale
charset:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=UTF-8:-*-pretty_font-*-12-*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, fvwm correctly determines the encoding of the font.
However, some fonts do not end with valid encoding names. When the font
name isn&#8217;t normal, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>-misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you need to add the encoding after the font name using a slash as a
delimiter. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>MenuStyle * Font -misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36/iso10646-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If fvwm finds an encoding, fvwm uses the iconv system functions to do
conversion between encodings. Unfortunately, there are no standards. For
conversion between iso8859-1 and UTF-8: a GNU system uses "ISO-8859-1"
and other systems use "iso881" to define the converters (these two names
are supported by fvwm). Moreover, in some cases it may be necessary to
use machine specific converters. So, if you experience problems you can
try to get information on your iconv implementation ("man iconv" may
help) and put the name which defines the converter between the font
encoding and UTF-8 at the end of the font name after the encoding hint
and a / (another possible solution is to use GNU libiconv). For example
use:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * Font -misc-fixed-*--14-*-iso8859-1/*/latin1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to use latin1 for defining the converter for the iso8859-1 encoding. The
"*" in between the "/" says to fvwm to determine the encoding from the
end of the font name. Use:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * Font \
-misc-fixed-*--14-*-local8859-6/iso8859-6/local_iso8859_6_iconv</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to force fvwm to use the font with iso8859-6 as the encoding (this is
useful for bi-directionality) and to use local_iso8859_6_iconv for
defining the converters.</p>

<h2 id="_command_expansion">COMMAND EXPANSION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs parameter
expansion. A parameter is a '$' followed by a word enclosed in brackets
($[&#8230;&#8203;]) or a single special character. If fvwm encounters an unquoted
parameter on the command line it expands it to a string indicated by the
parameter name. Unknown parameters are left untouched. Parameter
expansion is performed before quoting. To get a literal '$' use "$$".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a command is prefixed with a '-' parameter expansion isn&#8217;t performed.
This applies to the command immediately following the '-', in which the
expansion normally would have taken place. When uesed together with
other prefix commands it must be added before the other prefix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

<p>The longer variables may contain additional variables inside the name,
which are expanded before the outer variable.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of fvwm, some single letter variables were

<h2 id="_scripting_and_complex_functions">SCRIPTING AND COMPLEX FUNCTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of commands that
improve its scripting abilities. Scripts can be read from a file with
<strong>Read</strong>, from the output of a command with <strong>PipeRead</strong> or written as a
complex function with the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command. For the curious, section
7 of the fvwm FAQ shows some real life applications of scripting. Please
refer to the sections <strong>User Functions and Shell Commands</strong> and
<strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for details. A word of warning: during execution
of complex functions, fvwm needs to take all input from the mouse
pointer (the pointer is "grabbed" in the slang of X). No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is run. This can
confuse some programs. For example, the xwd program refuses to make
screen shots when run from a complex function. To achieve the same
functionality you can use the <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>PipeRead</strong> command instead.</p>

<h2 id="_menus">MENUS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before a menu can be opened, it has to be populated with menu items
using the <strong>AddToMenu</strong> command and bound to a key or mouse button with
the <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>PointerKey</strong> or <strong>Mouse</strong> command (there are many other ways to
invoke a menu too). This is usually done in the configuration file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm menus are extremely configurable in look and feel. Even the
slightest nuances can be changed to the user&#8217;s liking, including the
menu item fonts, the background, delays before popping up sub menus,
generating menus dynamically and many other features. Please refer to
the <strong>MenuStyle</strong> command to learn more.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Types of Menus</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>There are four slightly different types of menus:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Popup menus can appear everywhere on the screen on their own or
attached to a part of a window. The <strong>Popup</strong> command opens popup menus.
If the popup menu was invoked with a mouse button held down, it is
closed when the button is released. The item under the pointer is then
activated and the associated action is executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normal menus are very similar command, but slightly transient.
When invoked by clicking a mouse button, they stay open
and can be navigated with no button held. But if invoked by a
button press followed by mouse motion, it behaves exactly like a popup
menu. The <strong>Menu</strong> command creates normal menus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Sub menus" are menus inside other menus. When a menu item that has the
<strong>Popup</strong> command as its action is selected, the named menu is opened as
a sub menu to the parent. Any type of menu can have sub menus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Tear off menus" are menus that have been "torn off" their original
context on the desktop like a normal window. They are created from
other menus by certain key presses or mouse sequences or with the
<strong>TearMenuOff</strong> command from inside a menu.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Menu Anatomy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Menus consist of any number of titles which are inactive menu items
that usually appear at the top of the menu, normal items triggering
various actions when selected, separator lines between the items, tear
off bars (a horizontal broken line) that tear off the menu when
selected, and sub menu items indicated with a triangle pointing left
or right, depending on the direction in which the sub menu appears.
All the above menu items are optional.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, if the menu is too long to fit on the screen, the excess
menu items are put in a continuation menu and a sub menu with the
string "More&#8230;&#8203;" is placed at the bottom of the menu. The "More&#8230;&#8203;"
string honors the locale settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there may be a picture running up either side of the menu (a
"side bar").</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Menu Navigation</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Menus are navigated with the keyboard and the mouse.
Many people prefer to use the mouse, but it can be tedious.
Keyboard navigation can be much faster.
While fvwm displays a menu, it can do nothing else. For example, new
windows do not appear before the menu is closed. However, this is not
exactly true for tear off menus. See the <strong>Tear Off Menus</strong> section for
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Mouse Navigation</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Moving the pointer over a menu selects the item below it. Normally
this is indicated by a 3d border around the item, but not all parts of
a menu can be selected. Pressing any mouse button while a menu is open
by default activates the item below it. Items of a popup menu are also
activated by releasing a held mouse button. In case of an item that
hides a sub menu, the sub menu is displayed if the pointer hovers over
the item long enough or moves close to the triangle indicating the sub
menu. This behaviour can be tuned with menu styles.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrolling a mouse wheel over a menu either wraps the pointer along the
menu (default), scrolls the menu under the pointer or act as if the
menu was clicked depending on the <em>MouseWheel</em> menu style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking on a selected item activates it - what happens exactly
depends on the type of the item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking on a title, a separator, the side bar, or outside the menu
closes the menu (exception: tear off menus can not be closed this
way). Pressing mouse button 2 over a menu title or activating a tear
off bar creates a tear off menu from the current menu. Clicking on a
normal menu item invokes the command that is bound to it, and clicking
on a sub menu item either closes all open menus and replaces them with
the sub menu or posts the menu (default).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Posting menus is meant to ease mouse navigation. Once a sub menu is
posted, only items from that sub menu can be selected. This can be
very useful to navigate the menu if the pointer tends to stray off the
menu. To unpost the menu and revert back to normal operation, either
click on the same sub menu item or press any key.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Just like with mouse navigation, the item below the pointer is
selected. This is achieved by warping the pointer to the menu items
when necessary. While a menu is open, all key presses are intercepted
by the menu. No other application can get keyboard input (although
this is not the case for tear off menus).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Items can be selected directly by pressing a hotkey that can be
configured individually for each menu item. The hotkey is indicated by
underlining it in the menu item label. With the <em>AutomaticHotkeys</em>
menu style fvwm automatically assigns hotkeys to all menu items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most basic keys to navigate through menus are the cursor keys
(move up or down one item, enter or leave a sub menu),</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(activate item) and</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(close menu). Numerous other keys can be used to navigate through
menus by default:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Enter</em>, <em>Return</em>, <em>Space</em> activate the current item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Escape</em>, <em>Delete</em>, <em>Ctrl-G</em> exit the current sequence of menus or

<p>A tear off menu is any menu that has been "torn off" the window it was
attached to and pinned to the root window. There are three ways to
tear off a menu: click on the menu title with mouse button 2, press</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>in the menu or activate its tear off bar (a horizontal bar with a
broken line). Tear off bars must be added to the menu as any other
item by assigning them the command <strong>TearMenuOff</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The builtin tear off actions can be overridden by undefining the
builtin menu actions bound to tear off. To remove the builtin mouse
button 2 binding, use:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Mouse 2 MT A -</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and to remove the builtin backspace binding, use:</p>

<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Key Backspace M A -</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the section <strong>Menu Bindings</strong> for details on how to assign other
bindings for tear off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that prior to fvwm 2.5.20 the tear off mouse bindings were
redefined in different way, which no longer work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The window containing the menu is placed as any other window would be.
If you find it confusing to have your tear off menus appear at random
positions on the screen, put this line in your configuration file:</p>

<p>A tear off menu is a cross breeding between a window and a menu. The
menu is swallowed by a window and its title is stripped off and
displayed in the window title. The main advantage is that the menu
becomes permanent - activating an item does not close the menu.
Therefore, it can be used multiple times without reopening it. To
destroy such a menu, close its window or press the Escape key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tear off menus behave somewhat differently than normal menus and
windows. They do not take the keyboard focus, but while the pointer is
over one of them, all key presses are sent to the menu. Other fvwm key
bindings are disabled as long as the pointer is inside the tear off
menu or one of its sub menus. When the pointer leaves this area, all
sub menus are closed immediately. Note that the window containing a
tear off menu is never hilighted as if it had the focus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A tear off menu is an independent copy of the menu it originated from.
As such, it is not affected by adding items to that menu or changing
its menu style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu first, the
option <em>TearOffImmediately</em> can be added to the <strong>Menu</strong> or <strong>Popup</strong>
command.</p>

<p>There is no end-of-menu symbol. Menus do not have to be defined in a
contiguous region of the <em>config</em> file. The quoted (or first word)
portion in the above examples is the menu label, which appears in the
menu when the user pops it up. The remaining portion is an fvwm
command which is executed if the user selects that menu item. An empty
menu-label ("") and the <strong>Nop</strong> function are used to insert a separator
into the menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The keywords <em>DynamicPopUpAction</em> and <em>DynamicPopDownAction</em> have a
special meaning when used as the name of a menu item. The action
following the keyword is executed whenever the menu is popped up or
down. This way you can implement dynamic menus. It is even possible to
destroy itself with <strong>DestroyMenu</strong> and the rebuild from scratch. When
the menu has been destroyed (unless you used the <em>recreate</em> option
when destroying the menu), do not forget to add the dynamic action
again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: Do not trigger actions that require user interaction. They may
fail and may screw up your menus. See the <strong>Silent</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Warning</strong> Do not issue <strong>MenuStyle</strong> commands as dynamic menu actions.
Chances are good that this crashes fvwm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The keyword <em>Greyed</em> will still render the menu item, but will grey it out
making the option unselectable.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several configurable scripts installed together with fvwm
for automatic menu generation. They have their own man pages. Some of
them, specifically <strong>fvwm-menu-directory</strong> and <strong>fvwm-menu-desktop</strong>, may
be used with <em>DynamicPopupAction</em> to create a directory listing or
GNOME/KDE application listing.</p>

<p>The keyword <em>MissingSubmenuFunction</em> has a similar meaning. It is
executed whenever you try to pop up a sub menu that does not exist.
With this function you can define and destroy menus on the fly. You
can use any command after the keyword, but if the name of an item
(that is a submenu) defined with <strong>AddToFunc</strong> follows it, fvwm executes
this command:</p>

invoked if the user double-clicks a button (or hits the key rapidly
twice if the menu is bound to a key) when bringing up the menu. If the
double click action is not specified, double clicking on the menu does
nothing. However, if the menu begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a
title or a separator) and the double click action is not given, double
clicking invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer
really was over the item).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>position</em> arguments allow placement of the menu somewhere on the
screen, for example centered on the visible screen or above a title
bar. Basically it works like this: you specify a <em>context-rectangle</em>

menu is moved from the upper left corner of the rectangle. The
<em>position</em> arguments consist of several parts:</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<p>the rectangle defined by &lt;_geometry_&gt; in X geometry format. Width

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the context-rectangle is omitted or invalid (e.g. "item" on a
window), "Mouse" is the default. Note that not all of these make sense
under all circumstances (e.g. "Icon" if the pointer is on a menu).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The offset values <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify how far the menu is moved from
its default position. By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the context rectangle&#8217;s width (height),
but with a trailing '<em>m</em>' the menu&#8217;s width (height) is used instead.
Furthermore a trailing '<em>p</em>' changes the interpretation to mean
pixels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of a single value you can use a list of values. All additional
numbers after the first one are separated from their predecessor by
their sign. Do not use any other separators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> are prefixed with "'<em>o</em>&lt;number&gt;" where &lt;number&gt; is an
integer, the menu and the rectangle are moved to overlap at the
specified position before any other offsets are applied. The menu and
the rectangle are placed so that the pixel at &lt;number&gt; percent of the
rectangle&#8217;s width/height is right over the pixel at &lt;number&gt; percent
of the menu&#8217;s width/height. So "o0" means that the top/left borders of
the menu and the rectangle overlap, with "o100" it&#8217;s the bottom/right
borders and if you use "o50" they are centered upon each other (try it
and you will see it is much simpler than this description). The
default is "o0". The prefix "o&lt;number&gt;" is an abbreviation for
"+&lt;number&gt;-&lt;number&gt;m".</p>

<p>This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse
button, and to bind a sub menu into a menu. The formats for the two
purposes differ slightly. The <em>position</em> arguments are the same as for
<strong>Menu</strong>. The command <em>default-action</em> is invoked if the user clicks a
button to invoke the menu and releases it immediately again (or hits
the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key). If the default
action is not specified, double clicking on the menu does nothing.
However, if the menu begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a title or

<p>Popup differs from <strong>Menu</strong> in that pop-ups do not stay up if the user
simply clicks. These are popup-menus, which are a little hard on the
wrist. <strong>Menu</strong> menus stay up on a click action. See the <strong>Menu</strong> command
for an explanation of the interactive behavior of menus. A menu can be
open up to ten times at once, so a menu may even use itself or any of
its predecessors as a sub menu.</p>

<p>When assigned to a menu item, it inserts a tear off bar into the menu
(a horizontal broken line). Activating that item tears off the menu.
If the menu item has a label, it is shown instead of the broken line.
If used outside menus, this command does nothing. Examples:</p>

<p>Menu styles describe the looks and behaviour like normal styles do
for windows. Menu styles are assigned to individual or all menus,

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>BorderWidth</em> takes the thickness of the border around the menus in
pixels. It may be zero to 50 pixels. The default is 2. Using an
invalid value reverts the border width to the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>HilightBack</em> and <em>!HilightBack</em> switch hilighting the background of
the selected menu item on and off. The <em>ActiveColorset</em> background
color is used for the hilighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>HilightTitleBack</em> switches hilighting the background of menu titles
on. The <em>TitleColorset</em> background color is used for the hilighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ActiveFore</em> and <em>!ActiveFore</em> switch hilighting the foreground of the
selected menu item on and off. The <em>ActiveColorset</em> foreground color
is used for the hilighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MenuColorset</em> controls the colorset used to color the menu. If the
colorset has a pixmap or gradient defined, this is used as the background
of the menu. The shape mask from the colorset is used to shape the
menu. Please refer to the <strong>Colorsets</strong> section for details about
colorsets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ActiveColorset</em> controls the color of the active menu item, provided
the <em>HilightBack</em> or <em>ActiveFore</em> menu styles are used. If specified,
the hilight and shadow colors from the colorset are used too. The
pixmap and shape mask from the colorset are not used. Hilighting the
background or foreground can be turned off individually with the
<em>!ActiveFore</em> or <em>!HilightBack</em> menu styles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>GreyedColorset</em> works exactly like <em>MenuColorset</em>, but the foreground
from the colorset replaces the color given with the <em>Greyed</em> menu
style. No other parts of the colorset are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TitleColorset</em> works exactly like <em>MenuColorset</em>, but is used only
for menu titles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Translucent</em> controls a pseudo transparent effect that uses a image
of the desktop under the menu as its background image. This option
takes one value that is a number between 0 (fully translucent)
and 100 (not translucent), which is the percent of the translucency.
Use <em>!Translucent</em> (or no additional value) to turn the effect off.
The translucent effect only applies to normal menus and does not
apply to "torn off" menus. Note, only the menu background is
translucent, the <em>HilightBack</em> of the active item and
<em>HilightTitleBack</em> of the title are not. To have a fully translucent
menu use the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>MenuStyle * Translucent 60, !HilightBack, !HilightTitleBack, ActiveFore</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Hilight3DThick</em>, <em>Hilight3DThin</em> and <em>Hilight3DOff</em> determine if the
selected menu item is hilighted with a 3D relief. Thick reliefs are
two pixels wide, thin reliefs are one pixel wide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Hilight3DThickness</em> takes one numeric argument that may be between
-50 and +50 pixels. With negative values the menu item gets a pressed
in look. The above three commands are equivalent to a thickness of 2,
1 and 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Animation</em> and <em>!Animation</em> turn menu animation on or off. When
animation is on, sub menus that do not fit on the screen cause the
parent menu to be shifted to the left so the sub menu can be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Font</em> and <em>TitleFont</em> take a font name as an argument. If a font by
this name exists it is used for the text of all menu items. If it does
not exist or if the name is left blank the built-in default is used.
If a <em>TitleFont</em> is given, it is used for all menu titles instead of
the normal font.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopupDelay</em> requires one numeric argument. This value is the delay in
milliseconds before a sub menu is popped up when the pointer moves
over a menu item that has a sub menu. If the value is zero no
automatic pop up is done. If the argument is omitted the built-in
default is used. Note that the popup delay has no effect if the
<em>PopupImmediately</em> option is used since sub menus pop up immediately
then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopupImmediately</em> makes menu items with sub menus pop up it up as
soon as the pointer enters the item. The <em>PopupDelay option</em> is
ignored then. If <em>PopupDelayed</em> is used fvwm looks at the <em>PopupDelay</em>
option if or when this automatic popup happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopdownDelay</em> works exactly like <em>PopupDelay</em> but determines the
timeout of the <em>PopupDelayed</em> style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopdownImmediately</em> makes sub menus vanish as soon as the pointer
leaves the sub menu and the correspondent item in the parent menu.
With the opposite option <em>PopdownDelayed</em> the sub menu only pops down
after the time specified with the <em>PopdownDelay</em> option. This comes
handy when the pointer often strays off the menu item when trying to
move into the sub menu. Whenever there is a conflict between the
<em>PopupImmediately</em>, <em>PopupDelayed</em>, <em>PopupDelay</em> styles and the
<em>PopdownImmediately</em>, <em>PopdownDelayed</em>, <em>PopdownDelay</em> styles, the
<em>Popup&#8230;&#8203;</em> styles win when using mouse navigation and the <em>Popdown&#8230;&#8203;</em>
styles win when navigating with the keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopupOffset</em> requires two integer arguments. Both values affect where
sub menus are placed relative to the parent menu. If both values are
zero, the left edge of the sub menu overlaps the left edge of the
parent menu. If the first value is non-zero the sub menu is shifted
that many pixels to the right (or left if negative). If the second
value is non-zero the menu is moved by that many percent of the parent
menu&#8217;s width to the right or left.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopupActiveArea</em> requires an integer value between 51 and 100.
Normally, when the pointer is over a menu item with a sub menu and the
pointer enters the area that starts at 75% of the menu width, the sub
menu is shown immediately. This percentage can be changed with
<em>PopupActiveArea</em>. Setting this value to 100 disables this kind of
automatic popups altogether. The default value is restored if no or an
invalid value is given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TitleWarp</em> and <em>!TitleWarp</em> affect if the pointer warps to the menu
title when a sub menu is opened or not. Note that regardless of this
setting the pointer is not warped if the menu does not pop up under
the pointer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TitleUnderlines0</em>, <em>TitleUnderlines1</em> and <em>TitleUnderlines2</em> specify
how many lines are drawn below a menu title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SeparatorsLong</em> and <em>SeparatorsShort</em> set the length of menu
separators. Long separators run from the left edge all the way to the
right edge. Short separators leave a few pixels to the edges of the
menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TrianglesSolid</em> and <em>TrianglesRelief</em> affect how the small triangles
for sub menus is drawn. Solid triangles are filled with a color while
relief triangles are hollow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>DoubleClickTime</em> requires one numeric argument. This value is the
time in milliseconds between two mouse clicks in a menu to be
considered as a double click. The default is 450 milliseconds. If the
argument is omitted the double click time is reset to this default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SidePic</em> takes the name of an image file as an argument. The picture
is drawn along the left side of the menu. The <em>SidePic</em> option can be
overridden by a menu specific side pixmap (see <strong>AddToMenu</strong>). If the
file name is omitted an existing side pixmap is removed from the menu
style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SideColor</em> takes the name of an X11 color as an argument. This color
is used to color the column containing the side picture (see above).
The SideColor option can be overridden by a menu specific side color
(see <strong>AddToMenu</strong>). If the color name is omitted the side color option
is switched off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PopupAsRootMenu</em>, <em>PopupAsSubmenu</em>, <em>PopupIgnore</em> and <em>PopupClose</em>
change the behavior when you click on a menu item that opens a sub
menu. With <em>PopupAsRootMenu</em> the original menu is closed before the
sub menu appears, with <em>PopupAsSubmenu</em> it is not, so you can navigate
back into the parent menu. Furthermore, with <em>PopupAsSubmenu</em> the sub
menu is held open (posted) regardless of where you move the mouse.
Depending on your menu style this may simplify navigating through the
menu. <strong>Any</strong> keystroke while a menu is posted reverts the menu back to
the normal behavior. With <em>PopupClose</em> the menu is closed when a sub
menu item is activated, and the menu stays open if <em>PopupIgnore</em> is
used (even if the menu was invoked with the <strong>Popup</strong> command).
<em>PopupAsSubmenu</em> is the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RemoveSubmenus</em> instructs fvwm to remove sub menu when you move back
into the parent menu. With <em>HoldSubmenus</em> the sub menu remains
visible. You probably want to use <em>HoldSubmenus</em> if you are using the
<em>PopupDelayed</em> style. <em>RemoveSubmenus</em> affects menu navigation with
the keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SelectOnRelease</em> takes an optional key name as an argument. If the
given key is released in a menu using this style, the current menu
item is selected. This is intended for
<strong>WindowList</strong> navigation. The key name is a standard X11 key name as
defined in <em>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</em>, (without the <em>XK_</em> prefix),
or the keysym database <em>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</em>. To disable this
behavior, omit the key name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: Some X servers do not support KeyRelease events.
<em>SelectOnRelease</em> does not work on such a machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ItemFormat</em> takes a special string as its argument that determines
the layout of the menu items. Think of the format string as if it were
a menu item. All you have to do is tell fvwm where to place the
different parts of the menu item (i.e. the labels, the triangle
denoting a sub menu, the mini icons and the side pic) in the blank
area. The string consists of spaces,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>characters and formatting directives beginning with '%'. Any invalid
characters and formatting directives are silently ignored:</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%l</strong>, <strong>%c</strong> and <strong>%r</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the next item label. Up to three labels can be used. The item
column is left-aligned (<strong>%l</strong>), centered (<strong>%c</strong>) or right-aligned
(<strong>%r</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%i</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Inserts the mini icon.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%&gt;</strong> and <strong>%&lt;</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Insert the sub menu triangle pointing either to the right (<strong>%&gt;</strong>) or to
the left (<strong>%&lt;</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%|</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The first <strong>%|</strong> denotes the beginning of the area that is highlighted
either with a background color or a relief (or both). The second <strong>%|</strong>
marks the end of this area. <strong>%|</strong> can be used up to twice in the
string. If you do not add one or both of them, fvwm sets the margins
to the margins of the whole item (not counting the side picture).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%s</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Places the side picture either at the beginning or the end of the
menu. This directive may be used only once and only as the first or
last in the format string. If the <strong>%s</strong> is not at the beginning of the
string, menus are not drawn properly.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Space</strong>, <strong>Tab</strong>, <strong>%Space</strong> and <strong>%Tab</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Add gap of one space, or a tab, using the width of the menu font. When
using a tab, the size of the gap can be one to 8 spaces since the tab
position is a multiple of 8 from the edge of the menu. The whole
string must be quoted if spaces or tabs are used.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>%p</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Like Space and Tab <strong>%p</strong> inserts an empty area into the item, but with
better control of its size (see below).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can define an additional space before and after each of the
objects like this</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>%left.rightp</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means: if the object is defined in the menu (e.g. if it is <strong>%s</strong>
and you use a side picture, or it is <strong>%l</strong> for the third column and
there are items defined that actually have a third column), then add
<em>left</em> pixels before the object and <em>right</em> pixels after it. You may
leave out the <em>left</em> or the <em>.right</em> parts if you do not need them.
All values up to the screen width are allowed. Even negative values
can be used with care. The <strong>p</strong> may be replaced with any other
formatting directives described above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: Only items defined in the format string are visible in the
menus. So if you do not put a <strong>%s</strong> in there you do not see a side
picture, even if one is specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The <em>SubmenusLeft</em> style changes the default <em>ItemFormat</em>
string, but if it was set manually it is not modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: If any unformatted title of the menu is wider than the widest
menu item, the spaces between the different parts of the menu items
are enlarged to match the width of the title. Leading left aligned
objects in the format string (<strong>%l</strong>, <strong>%i</strong>, <strong>%&lt;</strong>, first <strong>%|</strong>) stick to
the left edge of the menu and trailing right aligned objects (<strong>%r</strong>,
<strong>%i</strong>, <strong>%&gt;</strong>, second <strong>%|</strong>) stick to the right edge. The gaps between the
remaining items are enlarged equally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3&gt;%1|"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is the default string used by fvwm: (side picture + 4 pixels gap)
(beginning of the hilighted area + 1 pixel gap) (mini icon + 5p)
(first column left aligned + 5p) (second column left aligned + 5p)
(third column right aligned + 5p) (second mini icon + 5p) (2p + sub
menu triangle + 3p) (1p + end of hilighted area).</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.1|%3.2&lt;%5i%5l%5l%5r%5i%1|%4s"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is used by fvwm with the <em>SubmenusLeft</em> option below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>VerticalItemSpacing</em> and <em>VerticalTitleSpacing</em> control the vertical
spacing of menu items and titles like <em>ItemFormat</em> controls the
horizontal spacing. Both take two numeric arguments that may range
from -100 to +100. The first is the gap in pixels above a normal menu
item (or a menu title), the second is the gap in pixels below it.
Negative numbers do not make much sense and may screw up the menu
completely. If no arguments are given or the given arguments are
invalid, the built-in defaults are used: one pixel above the item or
title and two below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>VerticalMargins</em> can be used to add some padding at the top and
bottom of menus. It takes two numeric arguments that must be positive
integers (or zero). If the number of arguments or its values are
incorrect, fvwm defaults both to 0, which means no padding at all. If
the values are correct, the first one is used for the top margin, and
the second one is used for the bottom margin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SubmenusLeft</em> mirrors the menu layout and behavior. Sub menus pop up
to the left, the sub menu triangle is drawn left and the mini icon and
side picture are drawn at the right side of the menu. The default is
<em>SubmenusRight</em>. The position hints of a menu are also affected by
this setting, i.e. position hints using <em>item</em> or <em>menu</em> as context
rectangle and position hints using <em>m</em> offsets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>AutomaticHotkeys</em> and <em>!AutomaticHotkeys</em> control the menu&#8217;s ability
to automatically provide hot-keys on the first character of each menu
item&#8217;s label. This behavior is always overridden if an explicit
hot-key is assigned in the <strong>AddToMenu</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</em> and <em>!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</em>
controls how menu items are invoked when used with hotkeys. By
default, if a given menu entry only has one completeable match for a
given hotkey, the action for that menu entry is invoked and the menu
is closed. This is due to the <em>UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</em> option.
However, the menu can be told to remain open, waiting for the user to
invoke the selected item instead when there is only one matched item
for a given hotkey, by using the <em>!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</em>
option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MouseWheel</em> controls the ability to scroll the menu using a mouse
wheel. It takes one argument, that can be one of ScrollsPointer,
ScrollsMenu, ScrollsMenuBackwards or ActivatesItem. ScrollsPointer
makes the mouse wheel scroll the pointer over a menu. This is the
default. ScrollsMenu and ScrollsMenuBackwards scroll the menu beneath
the pointer. ActivatesItem disables scrolling by mouse wheel and makes
the use of a mouse wheel act as if the menu was clicked. If no
argument is supplied the default setting is restored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ScrollOffPage</em> allows a menu to be scrolled out of the visible area
if <em>MouseWheel</em> is set to ScrollsMenu or ScrollsMenuBackwards. This is
the default. The opposite, <em>!ScrollOffPage</em> disables this behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>TrianglesUseFore</em> draws sub menu triangles with the foreground color
of the menu colorset (normally drawn with the hilight color).
<em>!TrianglesUseFore</em> disables this behaviour.</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>BugOpts</strong> [<em>option</em> [<em>bool</em>]], &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command controls several workarounds for bugs in third party
programs. The individual options are separated by commas. The optional
argument <em>bool</em> is a boolean argument and controls if the bug
workaround is enabled or not. It can either be "True" or "False" to
turn the option on or off, or "toggle" to switch is back and forth. If
<em>bool</em> is omitted, the default setting is restored.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>DebugRandR</em> activates monitor layout debug messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FlickeringMoveWorkaround</em> disables ConfigureNotify events that are
usually sent to an application while it is moved. If some windows
flicker annoyingly while being moved, this option may help you. Note
that if this problem occurs it is not an fvwm bug, it is a problem of
the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MixedVisualWorkaround</em> makes fvwm install the root colormap before it
does some operations using the root window visuals. This is only
useful when the <strong>-visual</strong> option is used to start fvwm and then only
with some configurations of some servers (e.g. Exceed 6.0 with an 8
bit PseudoColor root and fvwm using a 24 bit TrueColor visual).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>ModalityIsEvil</em> option controls whether Motif applications have
the ability to have modal dialogs (dialogs that force you to close
them first before you can do anything else). The default is to not
allow applications to have modal dialogs. Use this option with care.
Once this option is turned on, you have to restart fvwm to turn it
off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RaiseOverNativeWindows</em> makes fvwm try to raise the windows it
manages over native windows of the X server&#8217;s host system. This is
needed for some X servers running under Windows, Windows NT or Mac OS X.
Fvwm tries to detect if it is running under such an X server and
initializes the flag accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RaiseOverUnmanaged</em> makes fvwm try to raise the windows it manages
over override_redirect windows. This is used to cope with ill-mannered
applications that use long-lived windows of this sort, contrary to
ICCCM conventions. It is useful with the <em>Unmanaged</em> style option too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FlickeringQtDialogsWorkaround</em> suppresses flickering of the focused
window in some modules when using KDE or QT applications with
application modal dialog windows. By default this option is turned on.
This option may be visually disturbing for other applications using
windows not managed by fvwm. Since these applications are rare it is
most likely safe to leave this option at its default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>QtDragnDropWorkaround</em> suppresses the forwarding of unknown
ClientEvent messages to windows&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually this is harmless, but Qt
has problems handling unrecognised ClientEvent messages. Enabling this
option might therefore help for Qt applications using DragnDrop. This
option is off by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHIconicStateWorkaround</em> is needed by EWMH compliant pagers or
taskbars which represent windows which are on a different desktops as
iconified. These pagers and taskbars use a version of the EWMH
specification before version 1.2 (the current KDE 2 &amp; 3 versions).
These pagers and taskbars use the IconicState WM_STATE state to
determine if an application is iconified. This state, according to the
ICCCM, does not imply that a window is iconified (in the usual sense).
Turning on this option forces fvwm to establish an equivalence between
the IconicState WM_STATE state and the iconified window. This violates
ICCCM compliance but should not cause big problems. By default this
option is off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>DisplayNewWindowNames</em> enabled, fvwm prints the name, icon
name (if available), resource and class of new windows to the console.
This can help in finding the correct strings to use in the <strong>Style</strong>
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the <em>ExplainWindowPlacement</em> option is enabled, fvwm prints a
message to the console whenever a new window is placed or
<strong>PlaceAgain</strong>, is used. The message explains on which desk, page,
screen and position it was placed and why. This option can be used to
figure out why a specific window does not appear where you think it
should.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>DebugCRMotionMethod</em> option enables some debugging code in the
ConfigureRequest handling routines of fvwm. It is not helpful for the
user, but if you report a bug to the fvwm team we may ask you to
enable this option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>TransliterateUtf8</em> option enables transliteration during
conversions from utf-8 strings. By default fvwm will not transliterate
during conversion, but will fall back to alternate strings provided by
the clients if conversion from utf-8 fails due to characters which
have no direct correspondence in the target charecter set. Some
clients however neglect to set non utf-8 properties correctly in which
case this option may help.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>BusyCursor</strong> [<em>Option</em> <em>bool</em>], &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command controls the cursor during the execution of certain
commands. <em>Option</em> can be <em>DynamicMenu</em>, <em>ModuleSynchronous</em>, <em>Read</em>,
<em>Wait</em> or <em>*</em>. An option must be followed by a boolean argument
<em>bool</em>. You can use commas to separate individual options. If you set
an option to "True", then when the corresponding command is run, fvwm
displays the cursor of the <em>WAIT</em> context of the <strong>CursorStyle</strong>
command. "False" forces to not display the cursor. The default is:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>BusyCursor DynamicMenu False, ModuleSynchronous False, \
Read False, Wait False</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>*</em> option refers to all available options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Read</em> option controls the <strong>PipeRead</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>DynamicMenu</em> option affects the <em>DynamicPopupAction</em> and
<em>MissingSubmenuFunction</em> options of the <strong>AddToMenu</strong> command. If this
option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not displayed during
a dynamic menu command even if this command is a <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>PipeRead</strong>
command and the <em>Read</em> option is set to "True".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>ModuleSynchronous</em> option affects the <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong>
command. If this option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not
displayed while fvwm waits for a module started by <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong>
to complete its startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Wait</em> option affects only the root cursor. During a wait pause
the root cursor is replaced by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully
functional (you can escape from the pause, see the <strong>EscapeFunc</strong>
command). If you want to use this option and if you do not use the
default root cursor, you must set your root cursor with the
<strong>CursorStyle</strong> command.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ClickTime</strong> [<em>delay</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the maximum delay in milliseconds between a button press and
a button release for the <strong>Function</strong> command to consider the action a
mouse click. The default delay is 150 milliseconds. Omitting the delay
value resets the <strong>ClickTime</strong> to the default.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ClickTime also specifies the delay between two clicks to be interpreted as a
double-click.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ColormapFocus</strong> FollowsMouse | FollowsFocus</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, fvwm installs the colormap of the window that the cursor
is in. If you use</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>ColormapFocus FollowsFocus</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then the installed colormap is the one for the window that currently

<p>The defaults are shown in parentheses above. If you ever want to
restore the default cursor for a specific context you can omit the
second argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second argument is either the numeric value of the cursor as
defined in the include file <em>X11/cursorfont.h</em> or its name (without
the XC_ prefix). Alternatively, the xpm file name may be specified.
The name can also be <em>None</em> (no cursor) or <em>Tiny</em> (a single pixel as
the cursor).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, the cursor can be loaded from an (XPM, PNG or SVG)
image <em>file</em>. If fvwm is compiled with Xcursor support, full ARGB is
used, and (possibly animated) cursor files made with the <strong>xcursorgen</strong>
program can be loaded. Otherwise the cursor is converted to
monochrome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optional <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments (following a <em>file</em> argument)
specifies the hot-spot coordinate with 0 0 as the top left corner of
the image. Coordinates within the image boundary are valid and
overrides any hot-spot defined in the (XPM/Xcursor) image file. An
invalid or undefined hot-spot is placed in the center of the image.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>DefaultFont</strong> [<em>fontname</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>DefaultFont</strong> sets the default font to font <em>fontname</em>. The default
font is used by fvwm whenever no other font has been specified. To
reset the default font to the built-in default, omit the argument. The
default font is used for menus, window titles, icon titles as well as
the geometry feedback windows during a move or resize operation. To
override the default font in a specific context, use the <strong>Style</strong> *
<em>Font</em>, <strong>Style</strong> * <em>IconFont</em>, or <strong>MenuStyle</strong> commands.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>DefaultIcon</strong> <em>filename</em></dt>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Deschedule</strong> [<em>command_id</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes all commands that were scheduled with the id <em>command_id</em> with
the <strong>Schedule</strong> command from the list of commands to be executed unless
they were already executed. If the <em>command_id</em> is omitted, the value
of the variable $[schedule.last] is used as the id.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Emulate</strong> Fvwm | Mwm | Win</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are done by
fvwm. Right now this command affects where the move/resize feedback
window appears and how window placement is aborted. To have more Mwm-
or Win-like behavior you can call <strong>Emulate</strong> with <em>Mwm</em> or <em>Win</em> as its
argument. With Mwm resize and move feedback windows are in the center
of the screen, instead of the upper left corner. This also affects how
manual placement is aborted. See the <em>ManualPlacement</em> description.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>EscapeFunc</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>By default the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape allows for escaping from a
<strong>Wait</strong> pause and from a locked <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command. The
<strong>EscapeFunc</strong> command used with the <strong>Key</strong> command allows for
configuring this key sequence. An example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Key Escape A MC -
Key Escape A  S EscapeFunc</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>replaces the Ctrl-Alt-Escape  key sequence with Shift-Escape for aborting a
<strong>Wait</strong> pause and <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command.  <strong>EscapeFunc</strong> used outside the
<strong>Key</strong> command does nothing.</p>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>FakeClick</strong> [<em>command</em> <em>value</em>] &#8230;&#8203;</dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees
are made that it works for you. <em>FakeClick</em> can simulate mouse button
press and release events and pass them to fvwm or the applications.
The parameters are a list of commands which consist of pairs of
<em>command</em> tokens and integer <em>values</em>, The <em>press</em> and <em>release</em>
commands are followed by the appropriate mouse button number and
generate a button press or release event on the window below the
pointer. The <em>wait</em> commands pauses fvwm for the given number of
milliseconds. The <em>modifiers</em> command simulates pressing or releasing
modifier keys. The values 1 to 5 are mapped to Mod1 to Mod5 while 6, 7
and 8 are mapped to Shift, Lock and Control. The modifier is set for
any further button events. To release a modifier key, use the
corresponding negative number. The <em>depth</em> command determines to which
window the button events are sent. With a depth of 1, all events go to
the root window, regardless of the pointer&#8217;s position. With 2, the
event is passed to the top level window under the pointer which is
usually the frame window. With 3, events go to the client window.
Higher numbers go to successive sub windows. Zero (0) goes to the
smallest window that contains the pointer. Note that events propagate
upward.</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">

a key name. The key name is a standard X11 key name as defined in
<em>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</em>, (without the <em>XK_</em> prefix), or the
keysym database <em>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</em>. The <em>wait</em>,

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ImagePath</strong> <em>path</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
images (both monochrome and pixmap). To find an image given by a
relative pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in turn, and
uses the first file found.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;.ext", this means all
images in this directory have the extension ".ext" that should be
forced. The original image name (that may contain another extension or
no extension at all) is not probed, instead ".ext" is added or
replaces the original extension. This is useful, for example, if a
user has some image directories with ".xpm" images and other image
directories with the same names, but ".png" images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>path</em> may contain environment variables such as <em>$HOME</em> (or
<em>${HOME}</em>). Further, a '+' in the <em>path</em> is expanded to the previous

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>LocalePath</strong> <em>path</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a colon separated list of "locale path" in which to search
for string translations. A locale path is constituted by a directory
path and a text domain separated by a semicolon (';'). As an example
the default locale path is:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>/install_prefix/share/locale;fvwm</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for the <strong>ImagePath</strong> command, <em>path</em> may contain environment

<dd>
<p>The <em>command</em> is executed after about <em>delay_ms</em> milliseconds. This
may be useful in some tricky setups. The <em>command</em> is executed in the
same context window as the <strong>Schedule</strong> command. An optional integer
argument <em>command_id</em> may be given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal
format. This id can be used with the <strong>Deschedule</strong> command to remove
the scheduled command before it is executed. If no id is given, fvwm
uses negative id numbers, starting with -1 and decreasing by one with
each use of the <strong>Schedule</strong> command. Note that the <strong>Schedule</strong> command
and its arguments undergo the usual command line expansion, and, when
<em>command</em> is finally executed, it is expanded again. It may therefore
be necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not be
expanded twice.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: A window&#8217;s id as it is returned with $[w.id] can be used as the
<em>command_id</em>. Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Current Schedule 1000 $[w.id] WindowShade</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Schedule</strong> command also supports the optional keyword <em>Periodic</em>
which indicates that the <em>command</em> should be executed every
<em>delay_ms</em>. Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Schedule Periodic 10000 PipeRead '[ -N "$MAIL" ] &amp;&amp; echo \

<em>NoGeometryWithInfo</em> removes the geometries, but keep the desktop
information and indicates iconic windows. <em>NoDeskNum</em> causes fvwm to
not display the desktop number in the geometry or before the window
title with the <em>NoGeometryWithInfo</em> option. <em>NoNumInDeskTitle</em> is only
useful if a desktop name is defined with the <strong>DesktopName</strong> command. It
causes fvwm to not display the desktop number before the desktop name.
By default, the WindowList menu have a title which indicates the
current desk or the selected desktop if the <em>Desk</em> condition is used.
The <em>NoCurrentDeskTitle</em> option removes this title. <em>TitleForAllDesks</em>
causes fvwm to add a menu title with the desk name and/or number
before each group of windows on the same desk. With <em>NoLayer</em>, the
layer of the window is not displayed. The options <em>ShowPage</em>,
<em>ShowPageX</em> and <em>ShowPageY</em> enable displaying the page of the window

<p><strong>Move</strong> without options starts an interactive move.  The window may snap to
other windows and screen boundaries, configurable with the <strong>SnapAttraction</strong>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Holding down <em>Alt</em> disables snapping and allows one to switch pages
without any delay.  Interactive movement can be aborted with the

<em>South</em>/<em>S</em>/<em>Down</em>/<em>D</em>, or <em>West</em>/<em>W</em>/<em>Left</em>/<em>L</em>. The window will move
in the given direction until it hits another window or the
<strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong>/screen boundary. When a window is at the
<strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong>/screen boundary, it will move to the next monitor
in the given direction, if it exists. If a window is outside of the
current working area (partly off screen), it will move to the edge of
the working area. Windows will honor the EWMH working area and stop at
the <strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong> unless the literal option <em>ewmhiwa</em> is given. If
multiple <em>direction</em>(s) are given, the window will move the directions
in the order of the sequence stated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The literal option <em>Warp</em> will warp the mouse pointer to the window.
The literal option <em>all_windows</em> will consider all windows on the same
monitor instead of just the windows in the path the window is moving.
This allows moving to the boundary of a window it is next too. The literal
option <em>both_sides</em> will consider both the close side and the far side of
the window (by default only the close side is considered).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the literal option <em>snap</em> followed by a snap <em>type</em> of <em>windows</em>,
<em>icons</em>, or <em>same</em> is given, then the window will only stop if it hits
another window, icon, or the same type. If the literal option <em>layers</em>
followed by two integers specifying a <em>min</em> layer and <em>max</em> layer is given,
then only windows on the layers between <em>min</em> and <em>max</em> layers will stop
the window. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre># Shuffle the window Right.
Move shuffle Right
# Shuffle Up, only consider windows on Layer 3.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will move the window to the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> position (see below).
By default, the EWMH working area of each monitor is honoured (the
working area for each monitor is set via <strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong> and honors
any strut hints provided by windows on the monitor). This means that
if a window is placed outside the working area, the position of the
window will be adjusted to fit inside the working area of the screen
the center of the window is on. If the trailing option <em>ewmhiwa</em> is
given, then the window position will ignore the working area and its
position will not be adjusted (this option is needed to move windows
off the screen and to have full control of where it is placed). If
the option <em>Warp</em> is given then the pointer is warped to the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the literal option <em>screen</em> followed by a RandR screen name <em>S</em> is
specified, the coordinates are interpreted as relative to the given
screen. The width and height of the screen are used for the
calculations instead of the display dimensions. The <em>screen</em> is
interpreted as in the <strong>MoveToScreen</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the literal option <em>desk</em> followed by a desk number <em>N</em> is specified,
place the window on the specified desk after it has been moved. This can
serve two purposes, first you can move a window&#8217;s position and desk in a
single command. Second when a window is moved between monitors, its desk
is updated to be the same as the new monitor. This option can override
that behavior by specifying which desk the window should end up on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The positional arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can specify an absolute or relative
position from either the left/top (positive values) or right/bottom
(negative values) of the global screen (the bounding box that contains all
monitors) or specified <em>screen</em>. By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the screen&#8217;s width/height, but a trailing
'<em>p</em>' changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing '<em>w</em>'
means percent of the window width/height. To move the window relative to
its current position, add the '<em>w</em>' (for "window") prefix before the <em>x</em>
and/or <em>y</em> value. To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the '<em>m</em>' (for "mouse") prefix. To move the
window relative to the virtual screen coordinates, add the '<em>v</em>' (for
"virtual screen") prefix. This is mostly for internal use with FvwmPager,
but can be used to give exact coordinates on the virtual screen and is best
used with the '<em>p</em>' suffix. To leave either coordinate unchanged, "<em>keep</em>"
can be specified in place of <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For advanced uses, the arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can be used multiple
times, but without the prefix '<em>m</em>' or '<em>w</em>'. (See complex examples

page is (0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the
current number of horizontal pages specified in the <strong>DesktopSize</strong>

page is (M,N). Negative page numbers refer to pages from the
rightmost/lowest page. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are not given, the window is
moved to the current page (a window that has the focus but is
off-screen can be retrieved with this). Moving windows to a page
relative to the current page can be achieved by adding a trailing
'<em>p</em>' after any or both numerical arguments. To move the window
relative to its current location, add a trailing '<em>w</em>'. To move a
window to the previous page use <em>prev</em> as the single argument.</p>

<p>A cursor barrier is a box that the cursor cannot be moved outside of
(unless warped with <em>CursorMove</em> or <em>WarpToWindow</em>). The <em>left</em>, <em>top</em>,
<em>right</em>, and <em>bottom</em> values give the percent distance the box is placed
from each of the corresponding edges of the desktop. If the values end

<em>coords</em> is given, the values are interpreted as the left/top and
right/bottom coordinates of the box&#8217;s corners. If the option
<em>screen RandRname</em> is given, the positions are computed relative to the
specified monitor. Use <em>screen c</em> to place the barrier on the current
monitor.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple barriers can be created by calling <em>CursorBarrier</em> multiple times.
This allows creating multiple regions to confine the cursor to (such as each
monitor in a multi-monitor setup), then use <em>CursorMove</em> or <em>WarpToWindow</em>
to move the cursor between the barriers. If the command <em>destroy</em> is included,
all barriers are destroyed allowing free movement of the mouse again. If
<em>destroy</em> is followed by an integer <em>N</em>, only that barrier is destroyed
(barriers are numbered in the order they are created starting at 0). If the
integer is negative, this counts backwards, such as "-1" is the most recent
created barrier, "-2" is the second most recent, and so on. When a barrier
is destroyed, this renumbers all barriers after it. In practice this is
best used with <em>destroy -1</em> to destroy the most recent barrier without

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With just the parameter "forget" a maximized window reverts back into

<strong>ResizeMoveMaximize</strong>. If the window is not maximized, nothing happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the optional arguments <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em>, which are
expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can control the new
size of the window. An optional suffix '<em>p</em>' can be used to indicate
pixels instead of percents of the screen size. If horizontal is
greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension of the window is set to
<em>horizontal</em>*screen_width/100. If the value is smaller than 0 the size
is subtracted from the screen width, i.e. -25 is the same as 75. If
<em>horizontal</em> is "<em>grow</em>", it is maximized to current available space
until finding any obstacle. The vertical resizing is similar. If both
horizontal and vertical values are "grow", it expands vertically
first, then horizontally to find space. Instead of the horizontal
"grow" argument, "<em>growleft</em>" or "<em>growright</em>" can be used
respectively "<em>growup</em>" and "<em>growdown</em>".</p>
</div>

<p>The optional <em>flags</em> argument is a space separated list containing the
following key words: <em>fullscreen</em>, <em>ewmhiwa</em>, <em>growonwindowlayer</em>,
<em>growonlayers</em>, <em>keepgrowing</em>, <em>all_windows</em>, <em>both_sides</em>, and <em>screen</em>.
<em>fullscreen</em> causes the window to become fullscreened if the appropriate
EWMH hint is set. <em>ewmhiwa</em> causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working area.
<em>growonwindowlayer</em> causes the various grow methods to ignore windows with
a layer other than the current layer of the window which is maximized. The
<em>growonlayers</em> option must have two integer arguments. The first one is
the minimum layer and the second one the maximum layer to use. Windows that
are outside of this range of layers are ignored by the grow methods. A
negative value as the first or second argument means to assume no minimum
or maximum layer. The <em>all_windows</em> option will consider all windows on the
same monitor in the direction the window is growing. This can be used to
grow a window to the edge of a window it is next to. The option <em>both_sides</em>
will consider both sides of other windows when growing (by default only the
close side is considered). This can be used to grow a window to the
boundaries of a window it is currently inside of. <em>keepgrowing</em> will allow
the window to keep growing beyond any window boundary it is currently
touching until it grows into the next closest window boundary. <em>screen</em>
must have an argument which specifies the screen on which to operate.</p>

<p>Toggles the window shade feature for titled windows. Windows in the
shaded state only display a title-bar. If <em>bool</em> is not given or
"<em>toggle</em>", the window shade state is toggled. If <em>bool</em> is "True",
the window is forced to the shaded state. If <em>bool</em> is "False", then
the window is forced to the non-shaded state. To force shading in a
certain direction, the <em>direction</em> argument can be used. Any of the
strings "<em>North</em>", "<em>South</em>", "<em>West</em>", "<em>East</em>", "<em>NorthWest</em>",
"<em>NorthEast</em>", "<em>SouthWest</em>", "<em>SouthEast</em>" or "<em>Last</em>" can be given.
The direction can be abbreviated with the usual one or two letters
"<em>N</em>", "<em>NW</em>", etc. Using a direction on a window that was already
shaded unshades the window. To shade it in a different direction, use
the <em>ShadeAgain</em> option. The direction <em>Last</em> shades the window in the
direction it last was shaded. If the window has never been shaded
before it is shaded as if no direction had been given. Windows without
titles can be shaded too. Please refer also to the options
<em>WindowShadeSteps</em>, <em>WindowShadeShrinks</em>, <em>WindowShadeScrolls</em>,
<em>WindowShadeLazy</em>, <em>WindowShadeAlwaysLazy</em> and <em>WindowShadeBusy</em>
options of the <strong>Style</strong> command. Examples:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: When a window that has been shaded with a <em>direction</em> argument
changes the direction of the window title (see <em>TitleAtTop</em> <strong>Style</strong>

strange. Windows that were shaded without a <em>direction</em> argument stay
shaded in the direction of the title bar.</p>

if the num-lock and scroll-lock keys interfere with your shortcuts. With
XFree86 '2' usually is the num-lock  modifier and '5' refers to the
scroll-lock key. To turn all these pesky modifiers off you can use this command:</p>

<p>Binds a keyboard key to a specified fvwm command, or removes the

keysym database <em>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</em>. Only key names that

are defined as in the <strong>Mouse</strong> binding. However, when you press a key
the context window is the window that has the keyboard focus. That is
not necessarily the same as the window the pointer is over (with
<em>SloppyFocus</em> or <em>ClickToFocus</em>). Note that key bindings with the
'<em>R</em>' (root window) context do not work properly with <em>SloppyFocus</em>
and <em>ClickToFocus</em>. If you encounter problems, use the <strong>PointerKey</strong>
command instead. If you want to bind keys to a window with
<em>SloppyFocus</em> or <em>ClickToFocus</em> that are supposed to work when the
pointer is not over the window, fvwm assumes the pointer is over the
client window (i.e. you have to use the 'W' context).</p>

<em>Button</em> is the mouse button number. If <em>Button</em> is zero then any
button performs the specified function. Note that only mouse buttons 1
to 5 are fully supported by X11. Any number above this works only
partially. Complex functions can not be used with these buttons and
neither any operation that requires dragging the pointer with the
button held. This is due to limitations of X11. By default, the
highest allowed button number is 9.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Context</em> describes where the binding applies. Valid contexts are
'<em>R</em>' for the root window, '<em>W</em>' for an application window, '<em>D</em>' for
a desktop application (as kdesktop or Nautilus desktop), '<em>T</em>' for a
window title-bar, '<em>S</em>' for a window side, top, or bottom bar, '<em>[</em>',
'<em>]</em>', '<em>-</em>' and '<em>_</em>' for the left, right, top or bottom side only,
'<em>F</em>' for a window frame (the corners), '&lt;', '^', '&gt;' and '<em>v</em>' for
the top left, top right, bottom right or bottom left corner, '<em>I</em>' for
an icon window, or '<em>0</em>' through '<em>9</em>' for title-bar buttons, or any
combination of these letters. '<em>A</em>' is for any context. For instance,
a context of "FST" applies when the mouse is anywhere in a window&#8217;s
border except the title-bar buttons. Only 'S' and 'W' are valid for an
undecorated window.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special context '<em>M</em>' for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It can be used alone or together with 'T', 'S', 'I', '[',

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special context '<em>P</em>' controls what buttons that can be used to
place a window. When using this context no modifiers are allowed
(<em>Modifiers</em> must be N), no <em>window</em> is allowed, and the <em>Function</em>
must be one of <em>PlaceWindow</em>, <em>PlaceWindowDrag</em>,
<em>PlaceWindowInteractive</em>, <em>CancelPlacement</em>, <em>CancelPlacementDrag</em>,
<em>CancelPlacementInteractive</em> or <em>-</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PlaceWindow</em> makes <em>Button</em> usable for window placement, both for
interactive and drag move. <em>CancelPlacement</em> does the inverse. That is
makes <em>Button</em> to cancel move for both interactive and drag move. It
may however not override how new windows are resized after being
placed. This is controlled by the <strong>Emulate</strong> command. Also a window
being dragged can always be placed by releasing the button hold while
dragging, regardless of if it is set to <em>PlaceWindow</em> or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PlaceWindowDrag</em> and <em>PlaceWindowInteractive</em>/<em>CancelPlacementDrag</em>

<p>By default, the binding applies to all windows. You can specify that a
binding only applies to specific windows by specifying the window name
in brackets. The window name is a wildcard pattern specifying the
class, resource or name of the window you want the binding to apply
to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example shows how the same key-binding can be used to
perform different functions depending on the window that is focused:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A '<em>--</em>' action indicates that the event should be propagated to the
specified window to handle. This is only a valid action for
window-specific bindings.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that Fvwm actually intercepts all events for a window-specific
binding and (if the focused window doesn&#8217;t match any of the bindings)
sends a synthetic copy of the event to the window. This should be
transparent to most applications, however (for security reasons) some
programs ignore these synthetic events by default - xterm is one of
them. To enable handling of these events, add the following line to
your <em>~/.Xdefaults</em> file:</p>

<p><em>ClickToFocus</em> instructs fvwm to give the focus to a window when it
is clicked in. The default <em>MouseFocus</em> (or its alias
<em>FocusFollowsMouse</em>) tells fvwm to give a window the focus as soon
as the pointer enters the window, and take it away when the pointer
leaves the window. <em>SloppyFocus</em> is similar, but doesn&#8217;t give up the
focus if the pointer leaves the window to pass over the root window
or a ClickToFocus window (unless you click on it, that is), which
makes it possible to move the mouse out of the way without losing
focus. A window with the style <em>NeverFocus</em> never receives the
focus. This is useful for modules like <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>. for example.
Note: Once any of the "FP&#8230;&#8203;" styles has been used, the defaults
that come with the basic focus policies are not restored when the
latter are used again. For example, once !FPGrabFocus has been used,
using ClickToFocus does not restore FPGrabFocus.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The focus model can be augmented with several additional options. In

options may limit compatibility with older releases. In general,
options beginning with "FP" turn a feature on, while those beginning

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Windows with the <em>TitleAtBottom</em>, <em>TitleAtLeft</em> or <em>TitleAtRight</em>

the default placement. Even if the window has the <em>!Title</em> style
set, this affects the <strong>WindowShade</strong> command. Please check the
<strong>WindowShade</strong> command for interactions between that command and
these styles. Titles on the left or right side of the windows are
augmented by the following styles:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, the text in titles on the left side of a window is rotated
counterclockwise by 90 degrees from the normal upright position and
90 degrees clockwise for titles on the right side. It can also be
rotated in the opposite directions with <em>LeftTitleRotatedCW</em> if
<em>TitleAtLeft</em> is used, and with <em>RightTitleRotatedCCW</em> if
<em>TitleAtRight</em> is used. The defaults can be restored with
<em>LeftTitleRotatedCCW</em> and <em>RightTitleRotatedCW</em>. A normal horizontal
text may be rotated as well with <em>TopTitleRotated</em> if <em>TitleAtTop</em>
is used, and with <em>BottomTitleRotated</em> if <em>TitleAtBottom</em> is used.
The defaults can be restored with <em>TopTitleNotRotated</em> and
<em>BottomTitleNotRotated</em>.</p>

<p>By default the title bar decoration defined using the <strong>TitleStyle</strong>

<p><strong>Colorset</strong> takes the colorset number as its sole argument and

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconTitleRelief</em> takes one numeric argument that may be between -50

is omitted.</p>

<p><em>IconBackgroundRelief</em> takes one numeric argument that may be

omitted.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>HandleWidth</em> takes a numeric argument which is the width of the

<p><em>Icon</em> takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which is the
icon bitmap or pixmap to use. Icons specified this way override
pixmap icons, but not icon windows or the ewmh icon, provided by the
client in the application (with the WM_HINTS property or with the
ewmh _NET_WM_ICON property). The <em>IconOverride</em> style changes the
behavior to override any client-provided icons; the <em>NoIconOverride</em>
style changes the behavior to not override any client-provided
icons; the default overriding behavior can be activated with the
<em>NoActiveIconOverride</em> style. With this style, fvwm uses application
provided icons if the icon is changed but uses the icon provided in
the configuration file until then.</p>

<p><em>IconBox</em> takes no argument, four numeric arguments (plus optionally
a screen specification), an X11 geometry string or the string
"none":</p>

</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox geometry</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where <em>l</em> is the left coordinate, <em>t</em> is the top, <em>r</em> is right and
<em>b</em> is bottom. Negative coordinates indicate distance from the right
or bottom of the screen. If the first argument is the word <em>screen</em>,
the <em>scr-spec</em> argument specifies the RandR screen on which the
IconBox is defined ´or the additional 'w' for the screen where the
window center is located. This is only useful with multiple screens.
The "l t r b" specification is more flexible than an X11 geometry.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox -80 240 -1 -1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>defines a box that is 80 pixels wide from the right edge, 240 pixels
down from the top, and continues to the bottom of the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps it is easier to use is an X11 geometry string though:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>IconBox 1000x70-1-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places an 1000 by 70 pixel icon box on the bottom of the screen
starting in the lower right hand corner of the screen. One way to
figure out a geometry like this is to use a window that resizes in
pixel increments, for example, xv. Then resize and place the xv
window where you want the iconbox. Then use FvwmIdent to read the
windows geometry. The icon box is a region of the screen where fvwm
attempts to put icons for any matching window, as long as they do
not overlap other icons. Multiple icon boxes can be defined as
overflow areas. When the first icon box is full, the second one is
filled. All the icon boxes for one style must be defined in one
<strong>Style</strong> command. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * IconBox -80 240 -1 -1, \
  IconBox 1000x70-1-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Style command with the IconBox option replaces any icon box
defined previously by another Style command for the same style.
That&#8217;s why the backslash in the previous example is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The geometry for the icon box command takes the additional
screen specifier "@w" in case RandR is used. This designates the
screen where the window center is located. The additional screen
specifier is not allowed anywhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you never define an icon box, or you fill all the icon boxes,
fvwm has a default icon box that covers the screen, it fills top to
bottom, then left to right, and has an 80x80 pixel grid. To disable
all but the default icon box you can use IconBox without arguments
in a separate <strong>Style</strong> command. To disable all icon boxes including
the default icon box, the argument "none" can be specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hint: You can auto arrange your icons in the icon box with a simple
fvwm function. Put the "DeiconifyAndRearrange" function below in
your configuration file:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange

<p><em>MiniIcon</em> specifies a pixmap to use as the miniature icon for the
window. This miniature icon can be drawn in a title-bar button (see
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong>), and can be used by various fvwm modules (<strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>
and <strong>FvwmPager</strong>). It takes the name of a pixmap as an argument.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>WindowShadeShrinks</em> and <em>WindowShadeScrolls</em> control if the contents
of a window that is being shaded with the <strong>WindowShade</strong> command are
scrolled (default) or if they stay in place. The shrinking mode is a
bit faster</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>WindowShadeSteps</em> option selects the number of steps for
animation when shading a window with <strong>WindowShade</strong>. It takes one
number as its argument. If the number has a trailing '<em>p</em>' it sets the
number of pixels to use as the step size instead of a fixed number of
steps. 0 disables the animation. This happens too if the argument is
omitted or invalid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>WindowShade</strong> command has two modes of operation: busy and lazy
shading. Busy shading can be 50% slower than lazy shading, but the
latter can look strange under some conditions, for example, if the
window borders, buttons or the title are filled with a tiled pixmap.
Also, the window handles are not drawn in lazy mode and the border
relief may only be drawn partially right before the window reaches the
shaded state or tight after leaves the unshaded state. By default,
fvwm uses lazy mode if there are no bad visual effects (not counting
the window handles) and busy mode otherwise. Use the
<em>WindowShadeAlwaysLazy or WindowShadeBusy</em> to force using the lazy or
busy mode. The default setting is restored with <em>WindowShadeLazy</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ResizeOpaque</em> instructs fvwm to resize the corresponding windows with
their contents visible instead of using an outline. Since this causes
the application to redraw frequently it can be quite slow and make the
window flicker excessively, depending on the amount of graphics the
application redraws. The <em>ResizeOutline</em> style (default) negates the
<em>ResizeOpaque</em> style. Many applications do not like their windows
being resized opaque, e.g. XEmacs, Netscape or terminals with a pixmap
background. If you do not like the result, do not use the
<em>ResizeOpaque</em> style for these windows. To exempt certain windows from
opaque resizing you could use these lines in your configuration file:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>FixedPPosition</em> and <em>FixedPSize</em> make fvwm ignore attempts of the
program to move or resize its windows. To allow this kind of actions,
use the <em>VariablePPosition</em> or <em>VariablePSize</em> style. These styles may
sometimes affect the initial placement and dimensions of new windows
(depending on the application). If windows are created at strange
places, try either the <em>VariablePPosition</em> or <em>!UsePPosition</em> styles.
The <em>FixedPSize</em> style may screw up window dimensions for some
applications. Do Not use this style in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MoveByProgramMethod</em> affects how fvwm reacts to requests by the
application to move its windows. By default, fvwm tries to detect
which method to use, but it sometimes detects the wrong method. You
may come across a window that travels across the screen by a few
pixels when the application resizes it, moves to a screen border with
the frame decorations off screen, that remembers its position for the
next time it starts but appears in a slighly shifted position, or that
attepmts to become full screen but has the. Try out both options,
<em>UseGravity</em> and <em>IgnoreGravity</em> on the window (and that window only)
and see if that helps. By default, fvwm uses the <em>AutoDetect</em> method.
Once the method was detected, it is never changed again. As long as
fvwm can not detect the proper method, it uses <em>IgnoreGravity</em>. To
force fvwm to retry the detection, use one of the other two options
first and then use <em>AutoDetect</em> again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: This option was introduced to alleviate a problem with the ICCCM
specification. The ICCCM clearly states that the <em>UseGravity</em> option
should be used, but traditionally applications ignored this rule.</p>

<p><em>Closable</em> enables the functions <strong>Close</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong> and <strong>Destroy</strong> to be
performed on the windows. This is on by default. The opposite,
<em>!Closable</em>, inhibits the window to be closed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Iconifiable</em> enables the function <strong>Iconify</strong> to be performed on the
windows. This is on by default. The opposite, <em>!Iconifiable</em>, inhibits
the window from being iconified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Maximizable</em> enables the function <strong>Maximize</strong> to be performed on the
windows. This is on by default. The opposite, <em>!Maximizable</em>, inhibits
the window from being maximized.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>AllowMaximizeFixedSize</em> enables the function <strong>Maximize</strong> to be
performed on windows that are not resizable, unless maximization has
been disabled either using the style <em>!Maximizable</em> or through WM
hints. This is on by default. The opposite, <em>!AllowMaximizeFixedSize</em>,
inhibits all windows that are not resizable from being maximized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ResizeHintOverride</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program supplied
minimum and maximum size as well as the resize step size (the
character size in many applications). This can be handy for broken
applications that refuse to be resized. Do not use it if you do not
need it. The default (opposite) style is <em>NoResizeOverride</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]</em> Tells fvwm the
minimum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of
the total screen area. If the letter '<em>p</em>' is appended to either of the
values, the numbers are interpreted as pixels. If the letter '<em>c</em>' is
appended to either of the values, the numbers are in terms of the client
window&#8217;s size hints, which can be useful for windows such as terminals to
specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to deal with
windows that freak out if their window becomes too small. If you omit the
parameters or their values are invalid, both limits are set to 0 pixels
(which is the default value).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MaxWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]</em> Tells fvwm the
maximum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of
the total screen area. If the letter '<em>p</em>' is appended to either of the
values, the numbers are interpreted as pixels. If the letter '<em>c</em>' is
appended to either of the values, the numbers are in terms of the client
window&#8217;s size hints, which can be useful for windows such as terminals to
specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to force
large application windows to be fully visible. Neither <em>height</em> nor <em>width</em>
may be less than 100 pixels. If you omit the parameters or their values
are invalid, both limits are set to 32767 pixels (which is the default).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <em>IconifyWindowGroups</em> all windows in the same window group are
iconified and deiconified at once when any window in the group is
(de)iconified. The default is <em>IconifyWindowGroupsOff</em>, which disables
this behavior. Although a number of applications use the window group
hint, it is rarely used in a proper way, so it is probably best to use
<em>IconifyWindowGroups</em> only for selected applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>SnapAttraction</em> affects interactive window movement: If
during an interactive move the window or icon comes within <em>proximity</em>
pixels of another the window or icon, it is moved to make the borders
adjoin. The default of 0 means that no snapping happens. Calling this
command without arguments turns off snap attraction and restores the
default behavior. Please refer also to the <em>SnapGrid</em> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second argument optional and may be set to one of
the five following values: With <em>All</em> both icons and windows snap to
other windows and other icons. <em>SameType</em> lets windows snap only to
windows, and icons snap only to icons. With <em>Windows</em> windows snap
only to other windows. Similarly with <em>Icons</em> icons snap only to other
icons. With <em>None</em> no snapping takes place. This option can be useful
in conjunction with the thirs argument if you only want to snap
against the screen edges. The default behavior is <em>All</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>SnapGrid</em> defines an invisible grid on the screen. During
an interactive move a window or icon is positioned such that its
location (top left corner) is coincident with the nearest grid point.
The default <em>x-grid-size</em> and <em>y-grid-size</em> setting are both 1, which
is effectively no grid all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interactive move with both <em>SnapGrid</em> and <em>SnapAttraction</em> results
in the window being moved to be adjacent to the nearest window border
(if within snap proximity) or grid position. The window moves the
shortest distance possible to satisfy both <em>SnapGrid</em> and
<em>SnapAttraction</em>. Note that the x and y coordinates are not coupled.
For example, a window may snap to another window on the x axis while
snapping to a grid point on the y axis. Using this style without
arguments reinstates the default settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The styles <em>EdgeMoveDelay</em> and <em>EdgeResizeDelay</em> define how hard it
is to change the desktop viewport by moving or resizing a
window over the edge of the screen. The parameter tells how many
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm
moves the viewport. The command <strong>EdgeScroll</strong> determines how far the
viewport is scrolled. If -1 is given as the delay, page flipping is
disabled completely. The defaults are no delay for moving (0) and no
flipping for resizing (-1). Using these styles without any argument
restores the default settings. Note that, with</p>

<p>it is still possible to move or resize windows across the edge of the
current screen. See also <strong>EdgeThickness</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>EdgeMoveResistance</em> makes it easier to place a window
directly adjacent to a RandR screen&#8217;s edge. It takes one or two parameters.
The first parameter tells how many pixels over an outside edge of the
screen a window&#8217;s edge must move before it actually moves partially off
the screen. The optional second parameter does the same as the first, but
for inside edges (shared edge between two RandR monitors). If omitted,
there is no resistance between inside edges. Note that the center of the
window being moved determines the screen on which the window should be
kept. Both values are 0 (no resistance) by default. To restore the defaults,
the option <em>EdgeMoveResistance</em> can be used without any parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The option <em>InitialMapCommand</em> allows for any valid fvwm command or
function to run when the window is initially mapped by fvwm. Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style MyWindow StartsOnPage 0 0, InitialMapCommand Iconify</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would hence place the window called <em>MyWindow</em> on page 0 0 for
the current desk, and immediately run the <strong>Iconify</strong> command on that
window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that should <em>InitialMapCommand</em> be used as a global option for
all windows, but there is a need that some windows should not have
this command applied, then an action of <strong>Nop</strong> can be used on those
windows, as in the following example:</p>

<p>Applications can place windows at a particular spot on the screen
either by window manager hints or a geometry specification. When they
do neither, then the window manager steps in to find a place for the
window. Fvwm knows several ways to deal with this situation. The
default is <em>TileCascadePlacement</em>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PositionPlacement</em> [<em>Center</em>|<em>UnderMouse</em>|<em>move-arguments</em>] When
used without an argument, new windows are placed in the top left
corner of the display. With the argument <em>Center</em>, all new window

centered under the mouse pointer where possible. If the window is
unable to fit on the screen because the pointer is at the edge of the
screen, then the window is forced on-screen using this option. If any
other <em>move-arguments</em> are given, they are interpreted exactly as the
<strong>Move</strong> command does (with the exception that references to the current

<p><em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> automatically places new windows in a location
in which the overlapping area in pixels of other windows is minimized.
By default this placement policy tries to avoid overlapping icons and
windows on higher layers. This can be configured with the
<em>MinOverlapPlacementPenalties</em> style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MinOverlapPercentPlacement</em> is similar to <em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> but
tries to minimize the overlapped percentages of other windows instead
of the overlapped area in pixels. This placement policy tries to avoid
covering other windows completely and tries even harder not to cover
small windows. This can be configured with the
<em>MinOverlapPlacementPenalties</em> and
<em>MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties</em> styles.</p>

<p>To reset this style to the default values, prefix it with a '!'. This
style configures the <em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> and
<em>MinOverlapPercentPlacement</em> placement policy. The <em>normal</em> factor
affects normal windows, the <em>ontop</em> factor affects windows with a
greater layer than the window being placed, the <em>icon</em> factor affects
icons, the <em>sticky</em> factor affects sticky windows, the <em>below</em> factor
affects windows with a smaller layer than the window being placed, the
<em>strut</em> factor affects the complement of the EWMH working area if the
window being placed has the <em>EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea</em> style and
windows with an EWMH strut hint (i.e., a "please do not cover me"
hint) if the window being placed has the
<em>EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea</em> style. These factors represent
the amount of area that these types of windows (or area) are counted
as, when a new window is placed. For example, by default the area of
ontop windows is counted 5 times as much as normal windows. So
<em>MinOverlapPlacement</em> and <em>MinOverlapPercentPlacement</em> covers 5 times
as much area of another window before it will cover an ontop window.
To treat ontop windows the same as other windows, set this to 1. To
really, really avoid putting windows under ontop windows, set this to
a high value, say 1000. This style affects the window already mapped
and not the window which is currently placed. There is one exception
to this rule: in the case of the window being placed has the
<em>EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea</em> style the <em>strut</em> factor affects the
placed window.</p>

<p><em>ManualPlacement</em> (aka active placement). The user is required to
place every new window manually. The window only shows as a rubber
band until a place is selected manually. The window is placed when a
mouse button or any key except <em>Escape</em> is pressed. Escape aborts
manual placement which places the window in the top left corner of the
screen. If mouse button 2 is pressed during the initial placement of a
window (respectively <em>Shift</em> and mouse button 1 in case Mwm emulation
has been enabled with the <strong>Emulate</strong> command), the user is asked to
resize the window too.</p>

<p>It is possible to define buttons usable to place windows with the
<strong>Move</strong> command and the special context 'P' for placement (see <strong>Move</strong>
command). However, you can&#8217;t redefine the way to also resize the
window other than the way it is affected by the <strong>Emulate</strong> command. The
button used for placing the window can be checked with the

<p><em>!UsePPosition</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
position (PPosition hint) when adding new windows. Using PPosition is
required for some applications, but if you do not have one of those
it&#8217;s a real headache. Many programs set PPosition to something
obnoxious like 0,0 (upper left corner). Note: <em>!UsePPosition</em> is
equivalent to the deprecated option <em>!UsePPosition</em></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>!UseUSPosition</em> works like <em>!UsePPosition</em> but applies suppresses
using the user specified position indicated by the program (USPosition
hint). It is generally a bad thing to override the user&#8217;s choice, but
some applications misuse the USPosition hint to force their windows to
a certain spot on the screen without the user&#8217;s consent. Note:
<em>!UseUSPosition</em> is equivalent to the deprecated option <em>!USPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NoUseTransientPPosition</em> and <em>UseTransientPPosition</em> work like
<em>!UsePPosition</em> and <em>UsePPosition</em> but apply only to transient
windows. Note: <em>!UseTransientPPosition</em> is equivalent to the
deprecated option <em>!TransientPPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NoUseIconPosition</em> instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
icon position (IconPosition hint) when iconifying the window. Note:
<em>!UseIconPosition</em> is equivalent to the deprecated option
<em>!IconPosition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnDesk</em> takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on
which the window should be initially placed. Note that standard Xt
programs can also specify this via a resource (e.g. "-xrm '*Desk:
1'").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnPage</em> takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If one or three
arguments are given, the first (or only) argument is the desktop
number. If three arguments are given, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
identify the x,y page position on the virtual window. If two arguments
are given, they specify the page position, and indicate no desk
preference. If only one argument is given, <em>StartsOnPage</em> functions
exactly like <em>StartsOnDesk</em>. For those standard Xt programs which
understand this usage, the starting desk/page can also be specified
via a resource (e.g., "-xrm '*page: 1 0 2'"). <em>StartsOnPage</em> in
conjunction with <em>SkipMapping</em> is a useful technique when you want to
start an app on some other page and continue with what you were doing,
rather than waiting for it to appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnScreen</em> takes one argument. It must be a valid RandR name. A
new window is placed on the specified screen. The default is to place
windows on the screen that contains the mouse pointer at the time the
window is created. However, those windows which are not placed by fvwm
(i.e., those with a USPosition hint from a user specified geometry)
are normally placed in a position relative to all identified screens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsOnPageIncludesTransients</em> causes the <em>StartsOnPage</em> style to be
applied even for transient windows. This is not usually useful, since
transients are usually pop ups that you want to appear in your visible
viewport; but occasionally an application uses a transient for
something like a startup window that needs to be coerced into place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage</em> suppresses <em>StartsOnPage</em> or
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> placement in the event that both <em>ManualPlacement</em> and
<em>SkipMapping</em> are in effect when a window is created. This prevents
you from interactively placing a window and then wondering where it
disappeared to, because it got placed on a different desk or page.
<em>ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage</em> allows this to happen anyway. The
option has no effect if <em>SkipMapping</em> is not in effect, because fvwm
switches to the proper desk/page to perform interactive placement. The
default is <em>ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>;
<em>ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage</em> matches the way the old
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> style used to handle the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage</em> causes the initial capture (of an already
existing window) at startup to place the window according to the
<em>StartsOnPage</em> and <em>StartsOnScreen</em> desk, page and screen
specification. <em>CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em> causes fvwm to ignore
these settings (including <em>StartsOnDesk</em>) on initial capture. The
default is <em>CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage</em> causes a window to be placed according
to, or revert to, the <em>StartsOnPage</em> and <em>StartsOnScreen</em> desk, page
and screen specification on <strong>Restart</strong>. <em>RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>
causes fvwm to respect the current window position on <strong>Restart</strong>. The
default is <em>RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Layer</em> accepts one optional argument: a non-negative integer. This is
the layer the window is put in. If no argument is given, any
previously set value is deleted and the default layer is implied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StaysOnTop</em> puts the window in the top layer. This layer can be
changed by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StaysPut</em> puts the window in the put layer. This layer can be changed
by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StaysOnBottom</em> puts the window in the bottom layer. This layer can be
changed by the command <strong>DefaultLayers</strong>; the default is 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartsLowered</em> instructs fvwm to put the window initially at the
bottom of its layer rather than the default <em>StartsRaised</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>StartShaded</em> tells fvwm to shade the window. An optional direction
argument may be given, which can be one of "<em>North</em>", "<em>South</em>",
"<em>West</em>", "<em>East</em>", "<em>NorthWest</em>", "<em>NorthEast</em>", "<em>SouthWest</em>",
"<em>SouthEast</em>" or if no direction is given, the default is to shade
north.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SkipMapping</em> tells fvwm not to switch to the desk the window is on
when it gets mapped initially (useful with <em>StartsOnDesk</em> or
<em>StartsOnPage</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk</em> makes new windows that have the window group
hint set appear on the same desk as the other windows of the same
group. Since this behavior may be confusing, the default setting is
<em>ScatterWindowGroups</em>. The window group hint is ignored when placing
windows in this case.</p>

<p><em>DecorateTransient</em> causes transient windows, which are normally left
undecorated, to be given the usual fvwm decorations (title bar,
buttons, etc.). Note that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm
menus, are not managed by the window manager and still do not receive
decorations. <em>NakedTransient</em> (the default) causes transient windows
not to be given the standard decorations. You can only bind keys or
mouse buttons to the sides and the client part of an undecorated
window ('S' and ´W' contexts in bindings, see <strong>Mouse</strong> and <em>Key</em>
commands).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window with the <em>RaiseTransient</em> style that has transient windows
raises all its transients when it is raised. The <em>DontRaiseTransient</em>
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window with the <em>LowerTransient</em> style that has transient windows
lowers all its transients when it is lowered. The <em>DontLowerTransient</em>
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>StackTransientParent</em> style augments <em>RaiseTransient</em> and
<em>LowerTransient</em> styles. Raising a window with <em>StackTransientParent</em>
style transfers the raise action to the main window if the window
being raised is a transient and its main window has <em>RaiseTransient</em>
style; this effect makes raise on a transient act just like raise on
its main - the whole group is raised. Similar behavior holds for
lowering a whole group of transients when the main has
<em>LowerTransient</em> style. <em>DontStackTransientParent</em> turns this behavior
off. <em>(Dont)StackTransientParent</em> has no effect if <em>RaiseTransient</em>
and <em>LowerTransient</em> are not used.</p>

<p><em>EWMHDonateIcon</em> instructs fvwm to set the application ewmh icon hint
with the icon that is used by fvwm if the application does not provide
such hint (and if the icon used by fvwm is not an icon window).
<em>EWMHDonateMiniIcon</em> does the same thing for mini icons. This allows
compliant pager, taskbar, iconbox &#8230;&#8203;etc to display the same (mini)
icons as fvwm. Note that on some hardware (e.g., 8-bit displays) these
styles can slow down window mapping and that in general only one of
these styles is needed by a compliant application.
<em>EWMHDontDonateIcon</em> and <em>EWMHDontDonateMiniIcon</em> restore the defaults
which are to not set any ewmh (mini) icons hints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, if an application provides an ewmh icon hint of small size
(i.e., height and width less than or equal to 22), then fvwm uses this
icon as its mini icon. <em>EWMHMiniIconOverride</em> instructs fvwm to ignore
ewmh icons and to use the mini icon provided by the <em>MiniIcon</em> style.
<em>EWMHNoMiniIconOverride</em> restores the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHUseStackingOrderHints</em> causes fvwm to use EWMH hints and respect
EWMH hints which change the window layer.
<em>EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints</em> causes fvwm to ignore EWMH layer hints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An application can ask for some reserved space on the desktop by a
hint. In the EWMH terminology such a hint is called a strut and it is
used to compute the working area and may be used for window placement
and in the maximize command. <em>EWMHIgnoreStrutHints</em> causes fvwm to
ignore such hints, as <em>EWMHUseStrutHints</em>, causes fvwm to use it which
is the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHIgnoreStateHints</em> causes fvwm to ignore initial EWMH state hints
when a new window is mapped. The default <em>EWMHUseStateHints</em> causes
fvwm to accept such hints.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHIgnoreWindowType</em> causes fvwm to ignore EWMH window type
specification. The default <em>!EWMHIgnoreWindowType</em> causes fvwm to
style windows of specified types as such.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea</em> causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working
area when it executes a <strong>Maximize</strong> command. With
<em>EWMHMaximizeUseWorkingArea</em> the EWMH working area is used as with
<em>EWMHMaximizeUseDynamicWorkingArea</em> the EWMH dynamic working area is
used (the default).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea</em> causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH
working area when it places (or places again) a window. With
<em>EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea</em> the EWMH working area is taken in
account as with <em>EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea</em> the EWMH dynamic
working area is taken in account (the default). Note that with the

<p>The <em>BackingStore</em>, <em>BackingStoreOff</em> and <em>BackingStoreWindowDefault</em>
determine if the X server uses backing store for the window or not.
<em>BackingStore</em> means that the X server tries to keep the obscured
parts of a window in memory. This is usually slower if the client runs
on the same machine as the X server, but can be much faster if the
connection is slow (see also <em>SaveUnder</em> below). <em>BackingStoreOff</em>
disables backing store for the window. By default, fvwm does not
enable or disable backing store itself but leaves is as the window
requested it. To revert back to the application&#8217;s choice, use the
<em>BackingStoreWindowDefault</em> style.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: This style is useless if the X server does not allow backing
store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>SaveUnder</em> enables the corresponding window attribute in the X
server. For a window using this style, the X server tries to store the
graphics below it in memory which is usually slower if the client runs
on the same machine as the X server. <em>SaveUnder</em> may speed up fvwm if
the connection to the X server is slow (e.g. over a modem link). To
disable save under, use the <em>SaveUnderOff</em> style. This is the default.

support transparent colorsets require this setting. <em>Opacity</em> is the
default and should be used for all non-transparent clients for better
performance.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>MwmFunctions</em> makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the mwm
prohibited operations hints that applications occasionally use.
<em>HintOverride</em> makes fvwm shade out operations that mwm would
prohibit, but it lets you perform the operation anyway. <em>NoFuncHint</em>
allows turns off the mwm hints completely.</p>
</div>

<p><em>OLDecor</em> makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the olwm and
olvwm hints that many older XView and OLIT applications use. Switch
this option off with <em>NoOLDecor</em>.</p>

<p><em>UseDecor</em> This style is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
There are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in
fvwm-3.0.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>UseDecor</em> accepts one argument: the name of a decor created with
<strong>AddToDecor</strong>. If no decor name is specified, the "Default" decor is
used. Windows do not actually contain decors, but are always assigned
to one. If the decor is later modified with <strong>AddToDecor</strong>, the changes

<p><em>Unmanaged</em> Windows with the <em>Unmanaged</em> style option are ignored by
fvwm. They are not decorated, can not be moved or resized, etc. You

<p><em>State</em> sets the initial value of one of the 32 user defined states
which are associated with each window. The state number ranges from 0

conditional commands. However, the styles can be overridden explicitly
in the condition with the <em>CirculateHit</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em> or

e.g. <strong>Current</strong> and <em>All</em>, do this by default. The styles
<em>CirculateSkipIcon</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em>, <em>CirculateSkipShaded</em> and

same as both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown") or "<em>Inactive</em>" (the same as
both "InactiveUp" and "InactiveDown") or any of these 6 with
"<em>Toggled</em>" prepended. The "Active" states apply to the focused
window, the "Inactive" ones apply to all other windows. The "Up"
states apply to the non pressed buttons, the "Down" ones apply to
pressed buttons. The "Toggled" prefix refers to maximized, shaded or
sticky windows that have the corresponding <em>MwmDecor&#8230;&#8203;</em> button style
set. Additionally, the following shortcuts may be used: "<em>AllNormal</em>",
"<em>AllToggled</em>", "<em>AllActive</em>", "<em>AllInactive</em>", "<em>AllUp</em>",
"<em>AllDown</em>". They are actually different masks for 4 individual states
from 8 total. These are supported too: "<em>AllActiveUp</em>",

for all buttons, which causes fvwm to draw any styles set with
<strong>TitleStyle</strong> before drawing the buttons. Finally, <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> is

<div class="paragraph">
<p>for the "ActiveDown" and "InactiveDown" states: When a button is
pressed, the relief is inverted. Because of this, to obtain the raised
look in "ActiveDown" or "InactiveDown" states you must specify the
opposite of the desired relief (i.e. <em>Sunk</em> for "ActiveDown" or
"InactiveDown"). This behavior is consistent, but may seem confusing
at first. The same applies to the "Toggled" states.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Button styles are classified as non-destructive, partially
destructive, or fully destructive. Non-destructive styles do not
affect the image. Partially destructive styles can obscure some or all
parts of the underlying image (i.e. <em>Pixmap</em>). Fully destructive
styles obscure the entire underlying image (i.e. <em>Solid</em> or one of the
<em>gradient</em> styles). Thus, if stacking styles with <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> (or
<strong>AddTitleStyle</strong> for title-bars), use care in sequencing styles to
minimize redraw.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The available styles are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Simple</em>, <em>Default</em>, <em>Solid</em>, <em>Colorset</em>, <em>Vector</em>, <em>?Gradient</em>,
<em>Pixmap</em>, <em>AdjustedPixmap</em>, <em>ShrunkPixmap</em>, <em>StretchedPixmap</em>,
<em>TiledPixmap</em>, <em>MiniIcon</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The description of these styles and their arguments follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Simple</em> style does nothing. There are no arguments, and this
style is an example of a non-destructive button style.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Default</em> style conditionally accepts one argument: a number which
specifies the default button number to load. If the style command
given is <strong>ButtonStyle</strong> or <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong>, the argument is optional
(if given, it overrides the current button). If a command other than
<strong>ButtonStyle</strong> or <strong>AddButtonStyle</strong> is used, the number must be
specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Solid</em> style fills the button with a solid color. The relief
border color is not affected. The color is specified as a single
argument. This style is fully destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Colorset</em> <em>cs</em> [<em>alpha</em>] style fills the button with the Colorset
<em>cs</em>. The optional <em>alpha</em> argument is a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm to merge the colorset background onto the button using
this percentage. If the percentage is 0 the colorset background is
hidden and if it is 100 the colorset background is fully applied. The
default is 100. So, the destructiveness depends on the <em>alpha</em>
argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Vector</em> <em>num</em>
<em>X</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]x</strong><em>Y</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]@C &#8230;&#8203;</strong>
style draws a line pattern. Since this is a standard button style, the
keyword <em>Vector</em> is optional, <em>num</em> is a number of point
specifications of the form
<em>X</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]x</strong><em>Y</em><strong>[</strong><em>offset</em><strong>p]@C &#8230;&#8203;</strong> <em>X</em>
and <em>Y</em> are point coordinates inside the button, given in percents
(from 0 to 100). An optional absolute <em>offset</em> in pixels, can be given
as "+&lt;offset&gt;p" for a positive or "-&lt;offset&gt;p" for a negative offset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>C</em> specifies a line color (0 - the shadow color, 1 - the highlight
color, 2 - the background color, 3 - the foreground color, 4 - only
move the point, do not draw). The first point color is not used. You
can use up to 10000 points in a line pattern. This style is partially
destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specification is a little cumbersome:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>ButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then the button 2 decoration uses a 4-point pattern consisting of a
line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the shadow color (@0), and then to
(30,70) in the shadow color, and finally to (50,30) in the highlight
color (@1). Is that too confusing? See the fvwm web pages for some
examples with screenshots.</p>

<p>The <em>Gradient</em> styles denote color gradients. Fill in the question
mark with any one of the defined gradient types. Please refer to the
<strong>Color Gradients</strong> section for a description of the gradient syntax.
The gradient styles are fully destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Pixmap</em> style displays a pixmap. A pixmap should be specified as
an argument. For example, the following would give button number 2 the
same pixmap for all 4 states (2 active and 2 inactive), and button
number 4 all different pixmaps.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative
pathname (see <strong>ImagePath</strong>). If the pixmap cannot be found, the button
style reverts to <em>Simple</em>. Flags specific to the <em>Pixmap</em> style are
<em>Left</em>, <em>Right</em>, <em>Top</em>, and <em>Bottom</em>. These can be used to justify the
pixmap (default is centered for both directions). Pixmap transparency
is used for the color "None." This style is partially destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>AdjustedPixmap</em> style is similar to the <em>Pixmap</em> style. But the
image is resized to exactly fit the button.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

background. One pixmap is specified as an argument. Pixmap
transparency is not used. This style is fully destructive.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>MiniIcon</em> style draws the window&#8217;s miniature icon in the button,

mouse events, so if you have any kind of error along the lines of:
"mouse clicks at the edge of the screen do the wrong thing" you&#8217;re
having trouble with the pan frames and (assuming you do not use the

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>AddToFunc</strong> [<em>name</em> [I | J | M | C | H | D <em>action</em>]]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Begins or adds to a function definition. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc Move-or-Raise I Raise
 + M Move
 + D Lower</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The function name is "Move-or-Raise", and it could be invoked from a
menu or a mouse binding or key binding:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Mouse 1 TS A Move-or-Raise</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>name</em> must not contain embedded whitespace. No guarantees are
made whether function names with embedded whitespace work or not. This
behavior may also change in the future without further notice. The
letter before the <em>action</em> tells what kind of action triggers the
command which follows it. '<em>I</em>' stands for "Immediate", and is
executed as soon as the function is invoked. '<em>J</em>' is similar to
"Immediate" but is delayed until a button is pressed or released or
the pointer is moved, or the function completes. It is always executed
before the other function actions. '<em>M</em>' stands for "Motion", i.e. if
the user starts moving the mouse. '<em>C</em>' stands for "Click", i.e., if
the user presses and releases the mouse button. '<em>H</em>' stands for
"Hold", i.e. if the user presses a mouse button and holds it down for
more than <strong>ClickTime</strong> milliseconds. '<em>D</em>' stands for "Double-click".
The action '<em>I</em>' causes an action to be performed on the button-press,
if the function is invoked with prior knowledge of which window to act
on.</p>

<dd>
<p>Prints a message to the debug log file, which requires logging to be
enabled. See the <strong>-v</strong> option or <strong>PrintInfo</strong> for more information on both
enabling debug logging and the log file location. Potentially useful for
debugging things in your <em>config</em> or getting the value of variables.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>EchoFuncDefinition</strong> <em>function</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>EchoFuncDefinition</strong> is similar to the <strong>Echo</strong> command but prints
the definition for the given <em>function</em> to the debug log file. It is
useful to find out how fvwm handles quoting and for debugging functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Exec</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Executes <em>command</em>. You should not use an ampersand '&amp;' at the end of
the command. You probably want to use an additional "exec" at the
beginning of <em>command</em>. Without that, the shell that fvwm invokes to
run your command stays until the command exits. In effect, you&#8217;ll have
twice as many processes running as you need. Note that some shells are
smart enough to avoid this, but it never hurts to include the "exec"
anyway.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example binds function key</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this function doesn&#8217;t wait for <em>command</em> to complete, so
things like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ExecUseShell</strong> [<em>shell</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Makes the <strong>Exec</strong> command use the specified shell, or the value of the

default Bourne shell (<em>/bin/sh</em>).</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">

<p>Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse button.
The following example binds mouse button 1 to a function called
"Move-or-Raise", whose definition was provided as an example earlier
in this man page. After performing this binding fvwm executes the
"move-or-raise" function whenever button 1 is pressed in a window&#8217;s
title-bar.</p>

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>InfoStoreAdd</strong> <em>key</em> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stores the <em>value</em> at the given <em>key</em>. This is useful to store generic
information used in the lifetime of an fvwm config file. For example
storing program preferences for opening video files.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of this command is to store internal information to fvwm
which can be used bu fvwm functions, or when opening programs of a
certain type. Previous to this command the only way to do this was via
<strong>SetEnv</strong> but this is discouraged because it places such information in
the environment, which pollutes it and makes the information global to
other processes started by fvwm which may then modify them which might
not be what&#8217;s wanted. Hence the point of <strong>InfoStoreAdd</strong> is to still
allow for such information to be stored, but kept internal to fvwm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this way, one can build up as many key/value pairs as needed.
Recalling the value of a given key happens through fvwm&#8217;s usual
expansion mechanism. See the <strong>Command Expansion</strong> section for more
details. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>InfoStoreAdd teddybearprog xteddy

# Echo the value of teddybearprog
Echo $[infostore.teddybearprog]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Removing an entry from the InfoStore is done with the
<strong>InfoStoreRemove</strong> command.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>InfoStoreRemove</strong> <em>key</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Removes an entry at the given <em>key</em> from the InfoStore. Example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>InfoStoreRemove teddybearprog</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Nop</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Does nothing. This is used to insert a blank line or separator in a
menu. If the menu item specification is</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToMenu MyMenu " " Nop</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then a blank line is inserted. If it looks like</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>+ "" Nop</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then a separator line is inserted. Can also be used as the
double-click action for <strong>Menu</strong> or <strong>Popup</strong>.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>PipeRead</strong> <em>command</em> [quiet]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to read commands from the output of the <em>command</em>. This
<em>command</em> is executed by <em>/bin/sh</em> as if you typed it on the command
line. If the command consists of more than one word it must be quoted.
Useful for building up dynamic menu entries based on a directories
contents, for example. If the keyword <em>Quiet</em> follows the command no
message is produced if the <em>command</em> is not found.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToMenu HomeDirMenu
PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/*; \
do echo "+ $i Exec xterm -e vi $i"; done'</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The <strong>PipeRead</strong> changes the pointer to a watch cursor by default
during execution. However, some commands, for example xwd, need to
take control of the pointer themselves and do not work. To disable the
watch cursor, use the command prior to <strong>PipeRead</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>BusyCursor Read off</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>PipeRead</strong> command executes synchronously. If you want to <strong>Exec</strong>
something, but need the command to run synchronously, you might do
something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>PipeRead 'command 1&gt;&amp;2'</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The redirection causes any output from the program to go to stderr
instead of being read as a sequence of commands by fvwm. <strong>PipeRead</strong>
returns 1 if the given command could be executed or -1 if not (see the
section <strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for the meaning of return codes).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Read</strong> <em>filename</em> [quiet]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named <em>filename</em>. If the
keyword <em>Quiet</em> follows the command no message is produced if the file
is not found. If the file name does not begin with a slash ('/'), fvwm
looks in the user&#8217;s data directory, then the system data directory.
The user&#8217;s data directory is by default <em>$HOME/.fvwm</em>. It can be
overridden by exporting <em>FVWM_USERDIR</em> set to any other directory. The
<strong>Read</strong> command returns 1 if the given file could be read or -1 if not
(see the section <strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for the meaning of return
codes).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>SetEnv</strong> <em>variable</em> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to the shell&#8217;s
export or setenv command. The <em>variable</em> and its <em>value</em> are inherited
by processes started directly by fvwm. For example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>SetEnv height HEIGHT</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Silent</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>A number of commands require a window to operate on. If no window was
selected when such a function is invoked the user is asked to select a
window. Sometimes this behavior is unwanted, for example if the
function was called by a module and the window that was selected at
first does not exist anymore. You can prevent this by putting <strong>Silent</strong>
in front of the fvwm <em>command</em>. If a function that needs a window is
called with <strong>Silent</strong> without a window selected, it simply returns
without doing anything. If <strong>Silent</strong> is used on a user defined function
it affects all function and sub function calls until the original
function exits.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another usage of <strong>Silent</strong> is with binding commands <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>PointerKey</strong>
and <strong>Mouse</strong>, this disables error messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Silent</strong> also disables the error message for non-existent commands.
Note: This command is treated as a prefix to its <em>command</em>. Expansion
of the command line is done as if <strong>Silent</strong> was not there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Silent Move 0 0
Silent User_defined_function
# do not complain on keyboards without "Help" key
Silent Key Help R A Popup HelpMenu</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>UnsetEnv</strong> [<em>variable</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unset an environment variable, similar to shell&#8217;s export or unsetenv
command. The <em>variable</em> then is removed from the environment array
inherited by processes started directly by fvwm.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Wait</strong> <em>window</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only. It causes
execution of a function to pause until a new window matching <em>window</em>
appears. This can be a window&#8217;s name, class, or resource string. It
may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the usual
Unix filename manner. This is particularly useful in the
"InitFunction" if you are trying to start windows on specific
desktops:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + I Wait xterm
 + I GotoDesk 0 2
 + I Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
 507x750+0+0
 + I Wait xmh
 + I GotoDesk 0 0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it
to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the
xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input from
the modules is queued up and processed only after the window appears
or the command is aborted. For example, windows can not be focused
with <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> or <strong>FvwmPager</strong> during a wait.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can escape from a <strong>Wait</strong> pause by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape (where Alt is
the first modifier). To redefine this key sequence see the <strong>EscapeFunc</strong> command.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Status</strong> <em>On | Off</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Turns status either On or Off. This sends information in JSON format
down a named pipe (set via FVWM_STATUS_PIPE env var) about the current
desks and number of windows, etc. This is meant to provide a fast
means of supplying third-party tools information about what&#8217;s
happening in Fvwm. For example, the JSON could be manipulated and sent
to tools such as <em>lemonbar</em>, <em>polybar</em>, etc.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format of the JSON blob looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">

<h3 id="_conditional_commands">Conditional Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conditional commands are commands that are only executed if certain
conditions are met. Most conditional commands work on windows, like
<strong>Next</strong>, <strong>ThisWindow</strong> or <strong>All</strong>. There is one conditional command, <strong>Test</strong>,
that works on global conditions unrelated to windows. The syntax of the
conditions is described below. For readability, the list of conditions
is located at the end of this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Return Codes</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for the
command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the condition was
met) or 0 (if the condition was not met). Some commands may return -1
which means that an error occurred and the return code is useless. The
<strong>Break</strong> command returns -2. Additionally, the return codes of commands
run in a complex functions are passed to the invoking complex
function. The return code is used by the <strong>TestRc</strong> command. Please
refer to the commands' description for examples. The return code can
also be accessed through the variable <em>$[cond.rc]</em>. Non conditional
commands do not modify the return code of the last conditional
command. Important note: return codes are only defined inside
functions created with the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command and are not inherited
by sub functions. To run a command without altering the return code,
the <strong>KeepRc</strong> command can be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>The Ring of Windows</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally. Think of the focused window
as a cursor on the current position in the ring. The <strong>Next</strong> command
and many other commands search forwards through the ring for a
matching window, and <strong>Prev</strong> searches backwards. The windows in the
ring are either ordered by creation time (if the
<em>!FPSortWindowlistByFocus</em>, <em>NeverFocus</em> or <em>MouseFocus</em> styles are
used) or by the last time they had the focus.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>List of Conditional Commands</strong></dt>
<dd>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>All</strong> [<em>options</em>] [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Execute <em>command</em> on all windows meeting the conditions. It returns 1
if any window matches the condition and 0 otherwise. The execution
starts at the top of the window ring and continues towards the bottom.
The <em>options</em> can be any combination of <em>Reverse</em> and <em>UseStack</em>. If
the option <em>Reverse</em> is given the execution order is reversed. The
option <em>UseStack</em> makes All use the stacking order instead of the
window ring when walking through windows. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section
for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>, <em>CirculateHitIcon</em>
and <em>CirculateHitShaded</em>. They can be turned off by specifying
<em>!CirculateHit</em> etc. explicitly.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Any</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if any window which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>
exists. The command is run in the context of the root window. See
the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Break</strong> [<em>levels</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the break command is used in a function, function execution is
terminated immediately. Further commands of the function are not
processed. Normally, all nested invocations of complex functions are
left. An optional integer number <em>levels</em> may be given to break out
of the given number of nested functions and continue execution of a
higher level function. The <strong>Break</strong> command always has the return
code -2. Example:</p>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>AddToFunc PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
+ I Pick
+ I TestRc (Error) Break
+ I Raise
+ I Iconify off</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Current</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> on the currently focused window if it satisfies
all <em>conditions</em>. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of
conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,
<em>CirculateHitIcon</em> and <em>CirculateHitShaded</em>. They can be turned off

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Direction</strong> [FromPointer] <em>direction</em> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. Normally, the center of
the currently focused window or the context window in which the
command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
window, or when the <em>FromPointer</em> option is given, the current
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
<em>direction</em> may be one of "North", "Northeast", "East", "Southeast",
"South", "Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and "Center". Which window
<strong>Direction</strong> selects depends on angle and distance between the center
points of the windows. Closer windows are considered a better match
than those farther away. The <em>Center</em> direction simply selects the
window closest to the starting point. Returns -1 if an invalid
direction was given. See the <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of
conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>KeepRc</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Runs the <em>command</em> but does not alter the return code of the
previous command. Note: <strong>KeepRc</strong> is treated as a prefix to its
<em>command</em>. Expansion of the command line is done as if <strong>KeepRc</strong> was
not there.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Next</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on the next window which
satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. If the command is running in a window
context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section
for a list of conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>None</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> if no window which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>
exists. The command is run in the context of the root window.
Returns 1 if no window matches the conditions and 0 otherwise. See
<strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,
<em>CirculateHitIcon</em> and <em>CirculateHitShaded</em>. They can be turned off

</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>NoWindow</strong> <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em>, but removes the window context if any. This is
not really a conditional command, but a prefix that may be useful in
menu items that should operate without a window even if such menu is
bound to window decorations.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Pick</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Pick</strong> works like <strong>Function</strong> if invoked in the context of a window.
If invoked in the root window, it first asks the user to pick a
window and then executes the <em>command</em> in the context of that
window. This avoids annoying multiple selections with complex
functions. The command is executed only if the given <em>conditions</em>
are met. Returns -1 if no window was selected. See <strong>Conditions</strong>
section for a list of conditions.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Prev</strong> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on the previous window which
satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. If the command is running in a window
context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ScanForWindow</strong> [FromPointer] <em>dir1</em> <em>dir2</em> [(<em>conditions</em>)] <em>command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Performs <em>command</em> (typically <strong>Focus</strong>) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all <em>conditions</em>. Normally, the center of
the currently focused window or the context window in which the
command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
window, or when the <em>FromPointer</em> option is given, the current
position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
direction <em>dir1</em> may be one of "North", "NorthEast", "East",
"SouthEast", "South", "SouthWest", "West", and "NorthWest". Which
window <strong>ScanForWindow</strong> selects depends first on the position along
the primary axis given by <em>dir1</em>. If any windows have the exact same
coordinate along the primary axis, the secondary direction is used
to order the windows. The direction <em>dir2</em> may be one of the same
set of values as <em>dir1</em>. If <em>dir2</em> is not perfectly perpendicular to
<em>dir1</em>, ScanForWindow returns a failure. When using ScanForWindow
repeatedly with the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all
windows matching the conditions will eventually be found. If the
focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will wrap around to
the opposite side. Returns -1 if an invalid direction was given. See
<strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>

<p>The <em>EdgeHasPointer</em> [<em>direction</em>] test-condition is true if the
edge in the given direction currently contains the pointer. The
<em>EdgeIsActive</em> [<em>direction</em>] test-condition is true if the edge in
the given direction currently is active. An edge is active, and can
contain a pointer if either a command is bound to it or edge scroll
is available in that direction. The direction may be one of *
Any<em>,</em> North<em>,</em> Top<em>,</em> Up<em>,</em> West<em>,</em> Left<em>,</em> South<em>,</em>
Bottom<em>, </em> Down<em>,</em> Right* and * East<em>. If no direction is
specified </em>Any* is assumed.</p>

<p>The <strong>WindowId</strong> command looks for a specific window <em>id</em> and runs the

window id of the root window. The window indicated by
<em>id</em> may belong to a window not managed by fvwm. Although most

for example the <strong>WarpToWindow</strong> command. Returns -1 if no window with
the given id exists. See <strong>Conditions</strong> section for a list of conditions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command implies the conditions <em>CirculateHit</em>,

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Conditions</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <em>conditions</em> that may be given as an argument to any conditional
command are a list of keywords separated by commas, enclosed in
parentheses. Unless stated otherwise, conditional commands accept all
the conditions listed below. Note that earlier versions of fvwm
required the conditions to be separated by whitespace instead of
commas and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses (this is still
supported for backward compatibility).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the <em>conditions</em> may include one or more window names to
match to. If more than one window name is given, all of them must
match. The window name, icon name, class, and resource are considered
when attempting to find a match. Each name may include the wildcards
'*' and '?', and may consist of two or more alternatives, separated by
the character '|', which acts as an OR operator. (If OR operators are
used, they must not be separated by spaces from the names.) Each
window name can begin with '!', which prevents <em>command</em> if any of the
window name, icon name, class or resource match. However, '!' must not
be applied to individual names in a group separated by OR operators;
it may only be applied to the beginning of the group, and then it
operates on the whole group.</p>

or de-iconified), <strong>FvwmAuto</strong> (an auto raise module), <strong>FvwmBacker</strong> (to
change the background when you change desktops), <strong>FvwmBanner</strong> (to

answer packets sent by fvwm. For example, a module written as a shell
script may change labels of the <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> module to implement a

<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> [Expect <em>string</em>] [Timeout <em>secs</em>] <em>modulename</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command is very similar to <strong>Module</strong>. Fvwm
stops processing any commands and user input until the module sends a
string beginning with "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" back to fvwm. If the
optional <em>Timeout</em> is given fvwm gives up if the module sent no input
back to fvwm for <em>secs</em> seconds. If the <em>Expect</em> option is given, fvwm
waits for the given <em>string</em> instead. <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> should only
be used during fvwm startup to enforce the order in which modules are
started. This command is intended for use with the (currently
hypothetical) module that should be in place before other modules are
started.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: It is quite easy to hang fvwm with this command, even if a
timeout is given. Be extra careful choosing the string to wait for.
Although all modules in the fvwm distribution send back the "NOP
FINISHED STARTUP" string once they have properly started up, this may
not be the case for third party modules. Moreover, you can try to
escape from a locked <strong>ModuleSynchronous</strong> command by using the key

<h3 id="_colorsets">Colorsets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Colorsets are a powerful method to control colors. Colorsets create
appearance resources that are shared by fvwm and its modules. When a
colorset is modified all parts of fvwm react to that change. A colorset
includes a foreground color, background color, shadow and highlight
color (often based on the background color), background face (this
includes images and all kinds of gradients). There is a way to render
background face and specify other color operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>Colorset</strong> <em>num</em> [<em>options</em>]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Creates or modifies colorset <em>num</em>. Colorsets are identified by this
number. The number can start at zero and can be a very large number.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Warning: The highest colorset number used determines memory
consumption. Thus, if you define 'Colorset 100000', the memory for
100001 colorsets is used. Keep your colorset numbers as small as
possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By convention, colorsets are numbered like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre># 0 = Default colors
# 1 = Inactive windows
# 2 = Active windows
# 3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background
# 4 = Active menu entry
# 5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used)
# 6 = module foreground and background
# 7 = hilight colors</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need to have more colors and do not want to reinvent the wheel,
you may use the convention used in fvwm-themes, it defines the meaning
of the first 40 colorsets for nearly all purposes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets" class="bare">http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each colorset has four colors, an optional pixmap and an optional
shape mask. The four colors are used by modules as the foreground,
background, highlight and shadow colors. When a colorset is created it
defaults to a foreground of black and background of gray. The
background and foreground are marked as "average" and "contrast" (see
later) so that just specifying a pixmap or gradient gives sensible
results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>options</em> is a comma separated list containing some of the keywords:
fg, Fore, Foreground, bg, Back, Background, hi, Hilite, Hilight, sh,
Shade, Shadow, fgsh, Pixmap, TiledPixmap, AspectPixmap, Transparent,
RootTransparent, Shape, TiledShape, AspectShape, NoShape, ?Gradient,
Tint, fgTint, bgTint, Alpha, fgAlpha, Dither, NoDither, IconTint,
IconAlpha, Plain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fg</em>, <em>Fore</em> and <em>Foreground</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the foreground color. The special name <em>Contrast</em> may be used to
select a color that contrasts well with the background color. To reset
the foreground color to the default value you can simply omit the
color name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>bg</em>, <em>Back</em> and <em>Background</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the background color. It also sets the highlight and shadow colors to
values that give a 3d effect unless these have been explicitly set
with the options below. The special name <em>Average</em> may be used to
select a color that is the average color of the pixmap. If the pixmap
is tinted with the <em>Tint</em> option, the tint is not taken in account in
the computation of the average color. You should use the <em>bgTint</em>
option to get the "real" average color. The background color is reset
to the default value if the color name is omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>hi</em>, <em>Hilite</em> and <em>Hilight</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the highlight color. If the highlight color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>sh</em>, <em>Shade</em> and <em>Shadow</em> take a color name as an argument and set
the shadow color. If the shadow color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgsh</em> takes a color name as an argument and sets the color used by
the shadowing font effect. See the <strong>Font Shadow Effects</strong> section of
the fvwm man page. By default this color is computed from the
foreground and background colors. To switch back to the default the
color name can be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Pixmap</em>, <em>TiledPixmap</em> and <em>AspectPixmap</em> take a file name as an
argument, search the <strong>ImagePath</strong> and use it as the background pixmap.
Any transparent parts are filled with the background color. Not
specifying a file name removes any existing image from the colorset.
<em>TiledPixmap</em> produces repeated copies of the image with no scaling,
<em>Pixmap</em> causes the image to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and <em>AspectPixmap</em> stretches to fit but retains
the image aspect ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Transparent</em> creates a transparent background pixmap. The pixmap is
used as a window background to achieve root transparency. For this you
should use the <em>ParentalRelativity</em> option to the <strong>Style</strong> command. A
subsequent root background change may be detected or not, this depends
on the program used to set the background. If you use <strong>fvwm-root</strong>,
<strong>xsetbg</strong> (xli), <strong>FvwmBacker</strong> with solid or colorset colors or a recent
version of <strong>Esetroot</strong> (&gt;= 9.2) a background change is detected. If
background changes are not detected (e.g., if you use <strong>xv</strong> or
<strong>xsetroot</strong>) you can force detection by using the <strong>-d</strong> option of
fvwm-root:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xv -root -quit mybg.png; fvwm-root -d</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the way X implements transparency no guarantees can be made
that the desired effect can be achieved. The application may even
crash. If you experience any problems with this option, do not use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using outline move and resize (see the <strong>OpaqueMoveSize</strong> command and
the <em>ResizeOpaque</em> <strong>Style</strong> option) as well as setting the
<em>WindowShadeShrinks</em> style may help. The transparency achieved with
<em>Transparent</em> depends on whether the colorset is applied to the
foreground or the background of a window. In the second case the
transparency is relative to the parent window of the window on which
the colorset is defined. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Colorset 12 VGradient 200 grey30 grey60
Colorset 17 Transparent
*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>gives an IconMan with a vertical grey gradient background and the
buttons use the background (by transparency). To obtain a (root)
transparent IconMan:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Colorset 12 Transparent
Colorset 17 Transparent
Colorset 18 Transparent
Colorset 19 Transparent

*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17
*FvwmIconMan: FocusColorset 18
*FvwmIconMan: IconColorset  19</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Colorset IconMan option defines the IconMan window background, but
the PlainColorset and the FocusColorset are drawn on the foreground.
So, the transparency of the IconMan buttons is achieved by drawing
nothing. Now if this IconMan is swallowed in an FvwmButtons as:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmButtons:(Colorset 10, Swallow "FvwmIconMan" 'FvwmIconMan')</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then, <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> becomes a child of <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> and it is
transparent relative to <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>. So, in this case <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>
uses Colorset 10 as background. If you want root transparency use the
<em>RootTransparent</em> option. <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong>, and
<strong>FvwmIdent</strong>, are relatively simple. There is one main colorset option
which defines the background of the window and the other colorsets (if
any) are drawn on the foreground. The case of <strong>FvwmProxy</strong> is simpler,
the two colorsets refer to the window backgrounds. <strong>FvwmPager</strong> is more
complicated as almost everything in the pager are windows with some
parental relations (the mini windows are the child and the desktops
are the parents and all this is complicated by the hilighted page).
So, the colorsets apply to the background of these windows. You should
experiment. For <strong>FvwmForm</strong> and <strong>FvwmScript</strong> the situation is similar.
There is a main window (a child of the root window) which corresponds
to the main colorset and most of the widgets are windows which are
children of the main window. <em>Tint</em> may work or not with the
<em>Transparent</em> option. When the colorset is drawn on the foreground
<em>Tint</em> should work. In some cases, tinting may be very slow. Tinting
may work with fvwm menu (without animation). Tinting may work better
if your X server has backing store enabled (try xdpyinfo to see if
this the case). There is a chance that the backing store support of
your X server does not work well with the terrible hack used to Tint
the ParentRelative Pixmap. So, to get tinted root transparency it is
more safe to use the <em>RootTransparent</em> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>RootTransparent</em> [ <em>buffer</em> ] creates a root transparent background.
To make this option work, you must use an <strong>Esetroot</strong> compatible
program, fvwm-root with the --retain-pixmap option or <strong>FvwmBacker</strong>
with the RetainPixmap option (and colorset or solid backgrounds). The
<em>buffer</em> keyword is useful only when the <em>Tint</em> option is used too.
This speeds up creation of windows which use the colorset (useful for
fvwm menus) at the cost of memory usage. It also speeds up opaque move
and resize which can be unacceptably slow without <em>buffer</em>. However,
this option may add a lot of memory to your X server (depending on the
size of the image used to set the background). In summary, using
outline move and resize for modules which use such a colorset may be a
good idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Shape</em>, <em>TiledShape</em> and <em>AspectShape</em> take a file name as an
argument, search the <strong>ImagePath</strong> and use it as the shape bitmap.
<em>TiledShape</em> produces repeated copies of the bitmap with no scaling,
<em>Shape</em> causes the bitmap to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and <em>AspectShape</em> stretches to fit but retains
the bitmap aspect ratio. If the file is a pixmap in xpm format the
shape mask (all opaque pixels) of the pixmap is used. For png and svg
images, the shape mask is equivalent to all not completely transparent
pixels (alpha &gt; 0).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Warning</strong> Due to the way X11 implements shapes you cannot take back
making windows shaped. You may have to restart fvwm or the shaped
application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>?Gradient &#8230;&#8203;</em> creates a pixmap and stretches it to fit the window.
<em>?Gradient</em> may be one of <em>HGradient</em>, <em>VGradient</em>, <em>DGradient</em>,
<em>BGradient</em>, <em>SGradient</em>, <em>CGradient</em>, <em>RGradient</em> or <em>YGradient</em>. The
gradient types are as follows: H is horizontal; V is vertical; D is
diagonal from top left to bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from
bottom left to top right; S is concentric squares; C is concentric
circles; R is a radar like pattern and Y is a Yin Yang style (but
without the dots). Please refer to the <strong>Color Gradients</strong> section for
the syntax of gradients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Tint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or <em>?Gradient</em> to be
tinted with the specified color using the percentage. If the image is
transparent <em>Tint</em> tints only the image part. Unfortunately, a
colorset background specified using the <em>Transparent</em> option can give
strange results. See the <em>Transparent</em> option for details. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using <em>fg</em> to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. With no arguments this option
removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>bgTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using <em>bg</em> to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. If the <em>sh</em> and <em>hi</em> colors are
not specified, they are recomputed from the tinted bg color. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Alpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It causes
fvwm to merge the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or <em>?Gradient</em> with
the <em>bg</em> color using the percentage. If the percentage is 0 the image
is hidden and if it is 100 the image is displayed as usual (no merge).
The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>fgAlpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the text and the colorset background using the
percentage. If the percentage is 0 the text is hidden and if it is 100
the text is displayed as usual (no merge). This option has an effect
only with fonts loaded by Xft, see the <strong>Font Names and Font Loading</strong>
section. The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Dither</em> causes fvwm to dither the image defined using <em>?Pixmap</em> or
<em>?Gradient.</em> This is useful only with displays with depth less than or
equal to 16 (i.e., on displays which can only display less than 65537
colors at once). The dithering effect lets you simulate having more
colors available that you actually have. <em>NoDither</em> causes fvwm to do
not dither the images. <em>Dither</em> is the default if the depth is less
than or equal to 8 (a screen with 256 colors or less). In depth 15
(32768 colors) and 16 (65536 colors), the default is <em>NoDither</em>,
however this effect can be useful with images which contain a lot of
close colors. For example a fine gradient looks more smooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconTint</em> takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm or a module to tint the "icons" which are rendered
into the colorset background with the specified color using a
percentage. Here "icons" means, fvwm Icons, fvwm menu icons, MiniIcons
which represent applications in various modules, images loaded by
modules (e.g., images specified by the <em>Icon</em> <strong>FvwmButtons</strong> button
option) &#8230;&#8203;etc. With no arguments this option removes the icon tint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>IconAlpha</em> takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the "icons" which are rendered into the colorset
background using this percentage. The default is 100 and it is
restored if no argument is given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Note</em>: It is equivalent to use "Tint a_color rate" and "Alpha a" if a
= 100 and the bg color is a_color. This equivalence does not hold for
IconAlpha and IconTint as the background can be an image or a gradient
(and not a uniform color background). However, in some cases you can
achieve (almost) the same effect by using IconTint in the place of
IconAlpha. This is preferable as, in general, IconAlpha generates more
redrawing than IconTint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>NoShape</em> removes the shape mask from the colorset while <em>Plain</em>
removes the background pixmap or gradient.</p>

<p>A color gradient is a background that changes its color gradually from
one hue to a different one. Color gradients can be used by various
commands and modules of fvwm. There are eight types of gradients:
<strong>HGradient</strong> is a horizontal gradient, <strong>VGradient</strong> is vertical,
<strong>DGradient</strong> is diagonal from top left to bottom right, <strong>BGradient</strong> is
backwards diagonal from bottom left to top right, <strong>SGradient</strong> is
concentric squares, <strong>CGradient</strong> is concentric circles, <strong>RGradient</strong> is
a radar like pattern and <strong>YGradient</strong> is a Yin Yang style (but without
the dots).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The color gradient syntax has two forms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>?Gradient</strong> <em>colors</em> <em>start-color</em> <em>end-color</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form specifies a linear gradient. The arguments denote the total
number of <em>colors</em> to allocate (between 2 and 1000), the initial color
and the final color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>

<p>The second form specifies a nonlinear gradient. The arguments are: the

number of <em>segments</em>. For each segment, specify the starting <em>color</em>,
a relative <em>length</em>, then the ending color. Each subsequent segment

memory, so if you encounter performance problems with them you may be
better off by not using them. To improve performance you can try one

<h2 id="_environment">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The environment variables that have an effect on how fvwm operates are
the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>DISPLAY</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Fvwm starts on this display unless the <strong>-display</strong> option is given.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM_USERDIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to determine the user&#8217;s data directory for reading and writing
files. If this variable is not already set, it is set by fvwm to
<em>$HOME/.fvwm</em>, which is the default user&#8217;s data directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM3_LOGFILE</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to determine the path and filename to log debug information from
fvwm3. By default debug log is written to
<em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em>/fvwm3-output.log . If an absolute path is specified
(starting with /) then <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> is ignored, otherwise the log is
written to <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em>/<em>$FVWM3_LOGFILE</em> .</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM_DATADIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set by fvwm to the directory containing fvwm config and module data.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM_MODULEDIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set by fvwm to the directory containing the standard fvwm modules.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>SESSION_MANAGER</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Fvwm tries to contact this session manager.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>SESSION_MANAGER_NAME</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is used mainly to determine xsm running to work around its bug. If
this variable is set to "xsm", DiscardCommand is set as xsm expects it
and not as XSMP requires. If you run fvwm under xsm, you should set this
variable to "xsm", otherwise old state files are not removed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>SM_SAVE_DIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>If this is set, fvwm saves its session data in this directory. Otherwise
it uses <em>$HOME</em>. Note, the state files are named <em>.fs-??????</em> and
normally are removed automatically when not used anymore.</p>
