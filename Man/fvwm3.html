<p>fvwm3 - F? Virtual Window Manager for X11</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">

<p><strong>fvwm3</strong>

[<strong>-f</strong> <em>config-file</em>]
[<strong>-o</strong> <em>logfile</em>]
[<strong>-v</strong>]</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm is a window manager for X11 optimised for speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint and is extremely
customizable and extendible.  A large <em>virtual desktop</em> and
<em>multiple disjoint desktops</em> can be used separately or together.
The virtual desktop pretends that the video screen is really quite
large, and you can scroll around within the desktop.  The multiple
disjoint desktops pretend there are really several screens to work
at, but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm provides <em>keyboard accelerators</em> that allow one to perform practically
all window manager functions, including moving and resizing windows and
operating the menus, using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm does not distinguish between configuration and action commands.
Configuration commands typically set fonts, colors, menu contents, and
key and mouse function bindings, while action commands do things like
raising and lowering windows. Fvwm makes no such distinction and allows
anything to be changed at any time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_options">OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the command line options that are recognized by fvwm:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-i</strong> | <strong>--clientid</strong> <em>id</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-c</strong> | <strong>--cmd</strong> <em>config-command</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>config-command</em> instead of '<strong>Read</strong> <em>config</em>' (or
'<strong>Read</strong> <em>.fvwm2rc</em>') as its initialization command. (Note that up to 10
<strong>-f</strong> and <strong>-c</strong> parameters can be given, and they are executed in the
order specified.)</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any module started by command line arguments is assumed to be a module
that sends back config commands. All command line modules have to quit
before fvwm proceeds on to the StartFunction and setting border
decorations and styles. There is a potential deadlock if you start a
module other than <strong>FvwmPerl</strong> but there is a timeout
so fvwm eventually gets going.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, starting the pager this way hangs fvwm until the timeout,
but the following should work well:</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>fvwm -c "AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPager"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-d</strong> | <strong>--display</strong> <em>displayname</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Manage the display called <em>displayname</em> instead of the name obtained
from the environment variable <em>$DISPLAY</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-f</strong> <em>config-file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to read <em>config-file</em> instead of <em>~/.fvwm/config</em> as its
initialization file. <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> can also be used to change location
of default user directory <em>~/.fvwm</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-o</strong> <em>logfile</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Write log messages to <em>logfile</em>.  If <em>logfile</em> is '-', log to the
console.  (Does not turn on logging, see the <strong>-v</strong> option.)</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-h</strong> | <strong>--help</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A short usage description is printed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-r</strong> | <strong>--replace</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Try to take over from a previously running wm. This does not work unless
the other wm is ICCCM2 2.0 compliant.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-F</strong> | <strong>--restore</strong> <em>state-file</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-V</strong> | <strong>--version</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prints the version of fvwm to <em>stderr</em>. Also prints an information about
the compiled in features as stated at compiletime.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-C</strong> | <strong>--visual</strong> <em>visual-class</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>visual-class</em> for the window borders and menus.
<em>visual-class</em> can be "StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor",
"PseudoColor", "TrueColor" or "DirectColor".</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-I</strong> | <strong>--visualid</strong> <em>id</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Causes fvwm to use <em>id</em> as the visual id for the window borders and
menus. <em>id</em> can be specified as N for decimal or 0xN for hexadecimal.
See man page of xdpyinfo for a list of supported visuals.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-l</strong> | <strong>--color-limit</strong> <em>limit</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies a <em>limit</em> on the colors used in image, gradient and possibly
simple colors used by fvwm. In fact, fvwm (and all the modules) uses a
palette with at most <em>limit</em> colors. This option is only useful with
screens that display 256 colors (or less) with a dynamic visual
(PseudoColor, GrayScale or DirectColor). The default depends on your X
server and how you run fvwm. In most case this default is reasonable.
The <strong>-l</strong> option should be used only if you encounter problems with
colors. By default, fvwm tries to detect large pre-allocated palettes.
If such a palette is detected fvwm uses it and a priori the <strong>-l</strong> must
not be used. Moreover, in this case the <strong>-A</strong> and <strong>-S</strong> options are
forced. Note that XFree-4.2 pre-allocates 244 colors (if you use a
driver with Render support) leaving only a few free colors. This may
lead to some color problems (and nothing can be done). XFree-4.3 or
better pre-allocate only 85 colors. If no pre-allocated palette is auto
detected the defaults are as follow:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display depth 8 (256 colors)</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>PseudoColor: 68 (4x4x4 color cube + 4 grey)
GrayScale: 64 regular grey
DirectColor: 32 (3x3x3 color cube + 5 grey)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display depth 4 (16 colors)</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>PseudoColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
GrayScale: 8 regular grey
DirectColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that if you use a private color map (i.e., fvwm is started with the
<strong>-C</strong> or the <strong>-I</strong> options), then other defaults are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now what to do if you encounter problems with colors? The first thing to
do is to check if you really cannot run your X server with depth 15, 16
or better. Check your X server documentation. Note that some hardware
can support two different depths on the same screen (typically depth 8
and depth 24). If depth 8 is the default, you can force fvwm to use the
best depth by using the <strong>-C</strong> option with <em>TrueColor</em> as argument. So now
we assume that you are forced to run in depth 8 with a dynamic visual
because your hardware/driver cannot do better or because you need to use
an application which needs to run under this mode (e.g., because this
application needs read-write colors). What it should be understand is
that you have only 256 colors and that all the applications which use
the default color map must share these colors. The main problem is that
there are applications which use a lot or even all the colors. If you
use such application you may have no more free colors and some
applications (which used only a few colors) may fail to start or are
unusable. There are three things that can be done (and fvwm does not
really play a particular role, all applications are concerned). The
first is to run the applications which waste your (default) color map
with a private color map. For example, run netscape with the -install
option, run KDE or QT applications with the --cmap option, use the <strong>-C</strong>
option for fvwm. The disadvantage of this method is that it is visually
disturbing (see the <strong>ColormapFocus</strong> command for a better control of the
color maps switching). The second method is to limit the number of
colors that the applications use. Again, some applications have options
to specify a given color limit. With fvwm you may try various values, 61
(a special "visual" palette), 56 (a 4x4x3 color cube plus 6 grey), 29 (a
3x3x3 color cube plus 2 grey), 10 or 9. Also, you may use the <strong>-L</strong>
option. However, limiting the number of colors is not the definitive
solution. The definitive solution is to try cause applications which use
a lot of colors use the same colors. This is a difficult task as there
are no formal standards for this goal. However, some toolkits as QT and
GTK use color cubes as palettes. So, the idea is to configure your
applications/toolkits to all use the same color cube. Moreover, you can
use the colors in this color cube in your X resources configuration
files and/or as arguments to colors options. Fvwm can use any color cube
of the form RxGxB with 2 &lt;= R &lt;= 6, R = G, R-1 =&lt; B &lt;= R and B &gt;= 2. To
get an RxGxB color cube give an argument to <strong>-l</strong> an integer c &gt;= R*G*B
and &lt; (R+1)<strong>(G+1)*B if B=R and &lt; R*G</strong>(B+1) if B &lt; R (and different from
61). If c &gt; R*G*B, then some grey may be added to the color cube. You
can use the <strong>PrintInfo</strong> <em>Colors</em> [<em>1</em>] command to get information on
your fvwm colors setting. In particular, this command prints the palette
used by fvwm in rgb format (the last integer gives the number of times
fvwm has allocated the colors).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-L</strong> | <strong>--strict-color-limit</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
causes fvwm to use its palette for all the colors. By default, the
palette is used only for images and gradients.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-P</strong> | <strong>--visual-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
this option causes fvwm to use a palette designed for limiting the
"visual" color distance between the points of the palette. Moreover, for
better color sharing, if possible colors with a name in the X rgb data
base are used for defining the colors (with the hope that applications
and images prefer to use named colors). If the <strong>-l</strong> option is not used
this palette has 61 colors. This palette is also automatically selected
if 61 or 9 is used as argument to the <strong>-l</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-A</strong> | <strong>--allocate-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to allocate all the colors of its palette at
start up for reserving these colors for future use. This option forces
the <strong>-static-palette</strong> option. By default, fvwm allocates (reserves) a
color in its palette only if it needs this color.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-S</strong> | <strong>--static-palette</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to never free the colors in its palette. By
default, when fvwm does not need a color any more it frees this color so
that a new color can be used. This option may speed up image loading and
save a few bits of memory.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>--debug-stack-ring</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables stack ring debugging. This option is only intended for internal
debugging and should only be used by developers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><strong>-v</strong> | <strong>--verbose</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Enables debug logging. Writes in append mode to fvwm log file, which is
~/.fvwm/fvwm3-output.log by default. See ENVIRONMENT section on how to
override this location on fvwm3 startup using <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> or
<em>$FVWM3_LOGFILE</em> .</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Logging can also be dynamically toggled on and off using signals:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>SIGUSR1 : used as a signal to restart Fvwm
SIGUSR2 : used as a signal to toggle opening/closing debug log file</pre>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_anatomy_of_a_window">ANATOMY OF A WINDOW</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows. This border consists
of a bar on each side and a small L-shaped section on each corner. There
is an additional top bar called the title-bar which is used to display
the name of the window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar
buttons. The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively known as the
side-bars. The corner pieces are called the frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the built-in minimal configuration, dragging mouse button 1 in the
frame or side-bars begins a resize operation on the window. Dragging
mouse button 2 in the frame or side-bars begins a move operation. There
are raise/lower operations bound to a single clicking on borders.
Similarly for the window title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist. Their use is completely user
definable. One popular configuration uses one button on the left that is
used to bring up a list of window options and two buttons on the right
used to iconify and maximize the window. Another popular configuration
adds a close button to the right. The number of title-bar buttons used
depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them. See the <strong>Mouse</strong>
command.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_virtual_desktop">THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use them.
The screen is a viewport onto a <em>desktop</em> which may be larger than the
screen. Several distinct desktops can be accessed (concept: one desktop
for each project, or one desktop for each application, when view
applications are distinct). Since each desktop can be larger than the
physical screen, divided into m by n <em>pages</em> which are each the size of
the physical screen, windows which are larger than the screen or large
groups of related windows can easily be viewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The (m by n) size (i.e. number of pages) of the virtual desktops can be
changed any time, by using the <strong>DesktopSize</strong> command. All virtual
desktops must be (are) the same size. The total number of distinct
desktops does not need to be specified, but is limited to approximately
4 billion total. All windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in the
<strong>FvwmPager</strong>, a miniature view of the desktops. The pager is an accessory
program, called a module, which is not essential for the window manager
to operate. Windows may also be listed using the <strong>WindowList</strong> command or
the <strong>FvwmIconMan</strong> module.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm keeps the windows on the desktop in a layered stacking order; a
window in a lower layer never obscures a window in a higher layer. The
layer of a window can be changed by using the <strong>Layer</strong> command. The
concept of layers is a generalization of the <em>StaysOnTop</em> flag of older
fvwm versions. The <em>StaysOnTop</em> and <em>StaysPut</em> <strong>Style</strong> options are now
implemented by putting the windows in suitable layers and the previously
missing <em>StaysOnBottom</em> <strong>Style</strong> option has been added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Sticky</em> windows are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
"Sticking to the screen&#8217;s glass". They always stay put on the screen.
This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiffs, so you only need
to run one such gadget and it always stays with you. Icons can also be
made to stick to the glass, if desired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport. That
is:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +0+0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>creates a window in the upper left hand corner of the visible portion of
the screen. It is permissible to specify geometries which place windows
on the virtual desktop, but off the screen. For example, if the visible
screen is 1000 by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the
current viewport is at the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
invoking:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +1000+1000</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places a window just off of the lower right hand corner of the screen.
It can be found by moving the mouse to the lower right hand corner of
the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view. A geometry specified
as something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry -5-5</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>places the window&#8217;s lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower
right corner of the visible portion of the screen. Not all applications
support window geometries with negative offsets. Some applications place
the window&#8217;s upper right hand corner 5 pixels above and to the left of
the upper left hand corner of the screen; others may do just plain
bizarre things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a fvwm-specific extension to geometry strings which can also
enforce the geometry is relative to the given screen.  For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -geometry +0+0@n</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where 'n' can be one of a RandR monitor name, or an assigned monitor number.
For more details, see the RANDR SUPPORT section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desktop or page
other than the currently active one. The geometry technique mentioned
above (specifying x,y coordinates larger than the physical screen size),
however, suffers from the limitation of being interpreted relative to
the current viewport: the window may not consistently appear on a
specific page, unless you always invoke the application from the same
page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better way to place windows on a different page, screen or desk from
the currently mapped viewport is to use the <em>StartsOnPage</em> or
<em>StartsOnScreen</em> style specification (the successors to the older
<em>StartsOnDesk</em> style) in your <em>config</em> file. The placement is
consistent: it does not depend on your current location on the virtual
desktop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications that understand standard Xt command line arguments and
X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to specify the
start-up desk or page on the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>starts an xterm on desk number 1;</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>starts an xterm two pages to the right and one down from the upper left
hand page of desk number 3. Not all applications understand the use of
these options, however. You could achieve the same results with the
following lines in your <em>.Xdefaults</em> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>XTerm*Desk: 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>XTerm*Page: 3 2 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_randr_multi_screen_support">RANDR MULTI-SCREEN SUPPORT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm best supports multiple screens using the RandR X11 protocol. If
fvwm isn&#8217;t built with the RandR protocol then the multi screen support
is very limited, and it is suggested to rebuild with RandR. It is also
recommended to use 'EdgeScroll 0 0' on multi-screen displays to avoid
changing pages when moving the mouse between screens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Fvwm has been compiled with RandR support then it tracks the outputs
(displays) which it finds. These outputs are stored by name, which can be
found by running using the xrandr(1) command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Fvwm detects monitors, it adds them to a tree with a defined order, and
each monitor is assigned a number.  That order is top-down, left-to-right, so
for example, the following diagram illustrates a monitor layout and their
assigned number.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>A (0)
B (1)   C (2)    D (3)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence it is possible to then refer to the 2nd monitor and print its name via
expansion variables as:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>$[monitor.1.name]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which would print the name, <strong>B</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In doing so, Fvwm tracks events from RandR, such as when a given output
changes size, or has been added or removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to specific <strong>FvwmEvent</strong> conditions which can be used to track a
monitor&#8217;s change, there is a function called <em>RandRFunc</em> which the user can
define to be run when a screen event occurs (such as
enabling/disabling/resolution change):</p>

<p>Fvwm sets two environment variables which are inherited by its children.
These are <em>$DISPLAY</em> which describes the display on which fvwm is
running. <em>$DISPLAY</em> may be <em>unix:0.0</em> or <em>:0.0</em>, which doesn&#8217;t work too
well when passed through ssh to another machine, so <em>$HOSTDISPLAY</em> is
set to a network-ready description of the display. <em>$HOSTDISPLAY</em> always
uses the TCP/IP transport protocol (even for a local connection) so
<em>$DISPLAY</em> should be used for local connections, as it may use
Unix-domain sockets, which are faster.</p>

<p>into your <em>config</em>, but it is not recommended; do this only if you know
what you are doing. It is usually important to start applications or
modules after the entire config is read, because it contains styles or
module configurations which can affect window appearance and
functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard way to start applications or modules on fvwm&#8217;s start up is
to add them to an initialization function (usually <strong>StartFunction</strong> or
<strong>InitFunction</strong>). This way they are only started after fvwm finishes to
read and execute <em>config</em> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm has three special functions for initialization: <strong>StartFunction</strong>,
which is executed on startups and restarts; <strong>InitFunction</strong> and
<strong>RestartFunction</strong>, which are executed during initialization and restarts
(respectively) just after StartFunction. These functions may be
customized in a user&#8217;s <em>config</em> file using the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command
(described later) to start up modules, xterms, or whatever you&#8217;d like to
have started by fvwm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm has also a special exit function: <strong>ExitFunction</strong>, executed when
exiting or restarting before actually quitting. It could be used to
explicitly kill modules, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If fvwm is run under a session manager, functions <strong>SessionInitFunction</strong>
and <strong>SessionRestartFunction</strong> are executed instead of InitFunction and
RestartFunction. This helps to define the user&#8217;s <em>config</em> file to be
good for both running under a session manager and without it. Generally
it is a bad idea to start xterms or other applications in "Session*"
functions. Also someone can decide to start different modules while
running under a session manager or not. For the similar purposes
<strong>SessionExitFunction</strong> is used instead of ExitFunction.</p>

<h2 id="_modules">MODULES</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process but
transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Users can write their own modules
to do any weird or bizarre manipulations without bloating or affecting
the integrity of fvwm itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm
and the module to communicate with. The pipes are already open for the
module when it starts and the file descriptors for the pipes are
provided as command line arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by use
of the <strong>Module</strong> command. Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task and exit. If the module is still
active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm closes the communication
pipes and waits to receive a SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it
has detected the pipe closure and has exited. If modules fail to detect
the pipe closure fvwm exits after approximately 30 seconds anyway. The
number of simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system&#8217;s maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between 60
and 256.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command engine. Commands
are formatted just as in the case of a mouse binding in the <em>config</em>
setup file. Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted, as in the
sample module <strong>FvwmButtons</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="_icccm_compliance">ICCCM COMPLIANCE</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm attempts to be ICCCM 2.0 compliant. Check
<a href="http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/" class="bare">http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/</a> for more info. In addition, ICCCM
states that it should be possible for applications to receive any
keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut approach
used in fvwm and most other window managers. In particular you cannot
have the same keyboard shortcuts working with your fvwm and another fvwm
running within Xnest (a nested X server running in a window). The same
problem exists with mouse bindings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
Client accepts input or input focus: False</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window manager.
These windows can take the input focus by themselves, however. A number
of applications set this property, and yet expect the window manager to
give them the keyboard focus anyway, so fvwm provides a window style,
<em>Lenience</em>, which allows fvwm to overlook this ICCCM rule. Even with
this window style it is not guaranteed that the application accepts
focus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The differences between ICCCM 1.1 and 2.0 include the ability to take
over from a running ICCCM 2.0 compliant window manager; thus</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>fvwm; vi ~/.fvwm/config; fvwm -replace</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>resembles the <strong>Restart</strong> command. It is not exactly the same, since
killing the previously running wm may terminate your X session, if the
wm was started as the last client in your <em>.Xclients</em> or <em>.Xsession</em>
file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further additions are support for client-side colormap installation (see
the ICCCM for details) and the urgency hint. Clients can set this hint
in the WM_HINTS property of their window and expect the window manager
to attract the user&#8217;s attention to the window. Fvwm has two re-definable
functions for this purpose, "UrgencyFunc" and "UrgencyDoneFunc", which
are executed when the flag is set/cleared. Their default definitions
are:</p>

<h2 id="_extended_window_manager_hints">EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm attempts to respect the extended window manager hints (ewmh or EWMH
for short) specification:
<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html" class="bare">https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html</a> and
some extensions of this specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This support is configurable with styles and commands. These styles and
commands have EWMH as the prefix (so you can find them easily in this
man page).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a new Context 'D' for the <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>PointerKey</strong>, <strong>Mouse</strong>
commands. This context is for desktop applications (such as kdesktop and
Nautilus desktop).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a compliant taskbar asks fvwm to activate a window (typically when
you click on a button which represents a window in such a taskbar), then
fvwm calls the complex function <strong>EWMHActivateWindowFunc</strong> which by
default is Iconify Off, Focus and Raise. You can redefine this function.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I Iconify Off
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>additionally warps the pointer to the center of the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EWMH specification introduces the notion of Working Area. Without
ewmh support the Working Area is the full visible screen (or all your
screens if you have a multi head setup with RandR). However, compliant
applications (such as a panel) can ask to reserve space at the edge of
the screen. If this is the case, the Working Area is your full visible
screen minus these reserved spaces. If a panel can be hidden by clicking
on a button the Working Area does not change (as you can unhide the
panel at any time), but the Dynamic Working Area is updated: the space
reserved by the panel is removed (and added again if you pop up the
panel). The Dynamic Working Area may be used when fvwm places or
maximizes a window. To know if an application reserves space you can
type "xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT" in a terminal and select the
application. If four numbers appear then these numbers define the
reserved space as explained in the <strong>EwmhBaseStruts</strong> command.</p>

<p>The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button bindings,
colors, the virtual display size, and related items. The initialization
configuration file is typically called <em>config</em> (or <em>.fvwm2rc</em>). By
using the <strong>Read</strong> command, it is easy to read in new configuration files
as you go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lines beginning with '#' are ignored by fvwm. Lines starting with '*'
are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather than
configuration commands for fvwm itself). Like in shell scripts embedded
newlines in a configuration file line can be quoted by preceding them
with a backslash. All lines linked in this fashion are treated as a
single line. The newline itself is ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and action
commands, so anything mentioned in the fvwm commands section can be
placed on a line by itself for fvwm to execute as it reads the
configuration file, or it can be placed as an executable command in a
menu or bound to a mouse button or a keyboard key. It is left as an
exercise for the user to decide which function make sense for

the Font <strong>MenuStyle</strong> and the <strong>DefaultFont</strong> commands. Also, all the

All these styles and commands take a font name as an argument. This

Bold, Black), Roman is the slant or the style (other possibilities:
Regular, Oblique, Italic) size specifies the point size (for a pixel
size use pixelsize=), encoding allows for enforce a charset (iso8859-1
or iso10646-1 only; if no encoding is given the locale charset is
assumed). An important parameter is "minspace=bool" where bool is True
or False. If bool is False (the default?) Xft gives a greater font
height to fvwm than if bool is True. This may modify text placement,
icon and window title height, line spacing in menus and <strong>FvwmIdent</strong>,
button height in some fvwm modules &#8230;&#8203;etc. With a LCD monitor you may
try to add "rgba=mode" where mode is either rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr to
enable subpixel rendering. The best mode depends on the way your LCD
cells are arranged. You can pass other specifications in between ":", as
"foundry=foundry_name", "spacing=type" where type can be monospace,
proportional or charcell, "charwidth=integer", "charheight=integer" or
"antialias=bool" where bool is True or False. It seems that these
parameters are not always taken in account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To determine which Xft fonts are really loaded you can export
XFT_DEBUG=1 before starting fvwm and take a look to the error log. With
Xft2 you may use fc-list to list the available fonts. Anyway, Xft
support is experimental (from the X and the fvwm point of view) and the
quality of the rendering depends on number of parameters (the XFree and
the freetype versions and your video card(s)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After an Xft font name you can add after a ";" an XLFD font name (simple
or extended) as:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14;-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then, if either loading the Xft font fails or fvwm has no Xft support,
fvwm loads the font "-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal&#8212;&#8203;14-*". This allows
for writing portable configuration files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_font_and_string_encoding">Font and string encoding</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a font is loaded, fvwm finds its encoding (or charset) using its
name (the last two fields of the name). fvwm assumes that the strings
which are displayed with this font use this encoding (an exception is
that if an iso10646-1 font is loaded, then UTF-8 is assumed for string
encoding). In a normal situation, (i) a font is loaded by giving a font
name without specifying the encoding, (ii) the encoding of the loaded
font is the locale encoding, and then (iii) the strings in the fvwm
configuration files should use the locale encoding as well as the window
and icon name. With Xft the situation is bit different as Xft supports
only iso10646-1 and iso8859-1. If you do not specify one of these
encodings in the Xft font name, then fvwm does strings conversion using
(iii). Note that with multibyte fonts (and in particular with "CJK"
fonts) for good text rendering, the locale encoding should be the
charset of the font.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To override the previous rules, it is possible to specify the string
encoding in the beginning of a font description as follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=enc:_full_font_name_</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <em>enc</em> is an encoding supported by fvwm (usually font name charset
plus some unicode encodings: UTF-8, USC-2, USC-4 and UTF-16).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you may use an iso8859-1 locale charset and have an
<strong>FvwmForm</strong> in Russian using koi8-r encoding. In this case, you just have
to ask <strong>FvwmForm</strong> to load a koi8-r font by specifying the encoding in
the font name. With a multibyte language, (as multibyte font works well
only if the locale encoding is the charset of the font), you should use
an iso10646-1 font:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>"StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>if your <strong>FvwmForm</strong> configuration uses jisx0208.1983-0 encoding. Another
possibility is to use UTF-8 encoding for your <strong>FvwmForm</strong> configuration
and use an iso10646-1 font:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1</pre>

<p>or equivalently</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>"xft:Bitstream Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646-1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general iso10646-1 fonts together with UTF-8 string encoding allows
the display of any characters in a given menu, <strong>FvwmForm</strong> etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More and more, unicode is used and text files use UTF-8 encoding.
However, in practice the characters used range over your locale charset.
For saving memory (an iso10646-1 font may have a very large number of
characters) or because you have a pretty font without an iso10646-1 charset,
you can specify the string encoding to be UTF-8 and use a font in the locale
charset:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>StringEncoding=UTF-8:-*-pretty_font-*-12-*</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, fvwm correctly determines the encoding of the font.
However, some fonts do not end with valid encoding names. When the font
name isn&#8217;t normal, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>-misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you need to add the encoding after the font name using a slash as a
delimiter. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>MenuStyle * Font -misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36/iso10646-1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If fvwm finds an encoding, fvwm uses the iconv system functions to do
conversion between encodings. Unfortunately, there are no standards. For
conversion between iso8859-1 and UTF-8: a GNU system uses "ISO-8859-1"
and other systems use "iso881" to define the converters (these two names
are supported by fvwm). Moreover, in some cases it may be necessary to
use machine specific converters. So, if you experience problems you can
try to get information on your iconv implementation ("man iconv" may
help) and put the name which defines the converter between the font
encoding and UTF-8 at the end of the font name after the encoding hint
and a / (another possible solution is to use GNU libiconv). For example
use:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * Font -misc-fixed-*--14-*-iso8859-1/*/latin1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to use latin1 for defining the converter for the iso8859-1 encoding. The
"*" in between the "/" says to fvwm to determine the encoding from the
end of the font name. Use:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Style * Font \
-misc-fixed-*--14-*-local8859-6/iso8859-6/local_iso8859_6_iconv</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to force fvwm to use the font with iso8859-6 as the encoding (this is
useful for bi-directionality) and to use local_iso8859_6_iconv for
defining the converters.</p>

<h2 id="_command_expansion">COMMAND EXPANSION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs parameter
expansion. A parameter is a '$' followed by a word enclosed in brackets
($[&#8230;&#8203;]) or a single special character. If fvwm encounters an unquoted
parameter on the command line it expands it to a string indicated by the
parameter name. Unknown parameters are left untouched. Parameter
expansion is performed before quoting. To get a literal '$' use "$$".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a command is prefixed with a '-' parameter expansion isn&#8217;t performed.
This applies to the command immediately following the '-', in which the
expansion normally would have taken place. When uesed together with
other prefix commands it must be added before the other prefix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Pick -Exec exec xmessage '$[w.name]'</pre>

<p>The longer variables may contain additional variables inside the name,
which are expanded before the outer variable.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of fvwm, some single letter variables were

<p>The math expansion variables can be used to do some basic arithmetic
on the integers &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt;. These expressions can be used to add
(&#43;), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/), modulus
(%), and exponentiation (^). This can be useful when computing
the size of panels or locations of windows relative to a monitor, for
example $[math.-.$[monitor.$[monitor.primary].height],200] will
subtract 200 pixels from the height of the primary monitor. These can
also be nested for more complex operations,
$[math.&#43;.$[math.*.3,5],$[math.-.4,-2]]
is replaced with 21.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The comma in "&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;" is to allow for a future possibility of using floats.
All operations use C integer mathematics. The result of integer division is
the quotient. The modulus can be used to get the remainder of the integer
division. Note that the C modulus returns negative remainders for negative
values. Finally the exponentiation operation returns 1 if &lt;y&gt; is negative.</p>

<h2 id="_scripting_and_complex_functions">SCRIPTING AND COMPLEX FUNCTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of commands that
improve its scripting abilities. Scripts can be read from a file with
<strong>Read</strong>, from the output of a command with <strong>PipeRead</strong> or written as a
complex function with the <strong>AddToFunc</strong> command. For the curious, section
7 of the fvwm FAQ shows some real life applications of scripting. Please
refer to the sections <strong>User Functions and Shell Commands</strong> and
<strong>Conditional Commands</strong> for details. A word of warning: during execution
of complex functions, fvwm needs to take all input from the mouse
pointer (the pointer is "grabbed" in the slang of X). No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is run. This can
confuse some programs. For example, the xwd program refuses to make
screen shots when run from a complex function. To achieve the same
functionality you can use the <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>PipeRead</strong> command instead.</p>

<p>Fvwm starts on this display unless the <strong>-display</strong> option is given.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM_USERDIR</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to determine the user&#8217;s data directory for reading and writing
files. If this variable is not already set, it is set by fvwm to
<em>$HOME/.fvwm</em>, which is the default user&#8217;s data directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM3_LOGFILE</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Used to determine the path and filename to log debug information from
fvwm3. By default debug log is written to
<em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em>/fvwm3-output.log . If an absolute path is specified
(starting with /) then <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em> is ignored, otherwise the log is
written to <em>$FVWM_USERDIR</em>/<em>$FVWM3_LOGFILE</em> .</p>

<dt class="hdlist1"><em>FVWM_DATADIR</em></dt>

<p>This is used mainly to determine xsm running to work around its bug. If
this variable is set to "xsm", DiscardCommand is set as xsm expects it
