<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This module can be called to tile or cascade windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When tiling the module will tile the windows into a grid (table or matrix)
inside the bounding box (the current monitor&#8217;s working area by default).
Tiling is performed so that windows will not overlap. When moving and
resizing windows to fit into the grid, windows are resized to their nearest
increment size, specified by the window&#8217;s size hints (this is why sometimes
space might appear between tiled windows, common with terminals). Use the
<em>ResizeHintOverride</em> style on widows with increment size hints to override
this behavior (which removes the gaps).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When cascading the module will cascade the windows inside the bounding box
from the top left of the bounding box. Windows will be resized to fit the
bounding box and layering is performed so that consecutive windows all have
their titles visible underneath the previous window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The behavior of both tiling and cascading can be configured by the options
listed below. This can control the size of the bounding box, if windows are
resized, and which windows are affected, and so on.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_invocation">INVOCATION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FvwmRearrange is best invoked from a menu, keybinding, or button. There are
a number of command line options which can be used to control how windows
will be cascaded/tiled, described below. Invoking FvwmRearrange with no
options will auto tile (see _-auto_tile) windows on the current monitor:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmRearrange</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tiles all windows in the working area of the current monitor into
a grid. This size of the grid will be computed using the number of
windows trying to make the grid as square as possible. Windows on the top
row will be resized to take up any extra space filling the full working
area. Adding additional arguments can change the behavior, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmRearrange -tile -swap 10 10 90 90</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This invocation will tile windows in a single column with a bounding box
which starts at 10 by 10 percent into and down the monitor&#8217;s working area
and ends at 90 by 90 percent into and down the working area. Another example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmRearrange -cascade 10 2 80 70</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This invocation will cascade windows starting 10 by 2 percent into and down
the monitor&#8217;s working area. Windows will be resized so their height and width
are 75 percent of the bounding box, which ends at 80 by 70 percent of the
working area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FvwmRearrange can also be run multiple times on the same monitor with
different bounding boxes. This way you can better control how windows are
tiled. Consider the following example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>FvwmRearrange -tile -swap 0 0 35 100
FvwmRearrange 35 0 100 100</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first command will create a single column of windows located on the left
35% of the monitor, and the second will auto tile the windows on the right
65% of the monitor. This way you can control how windows are tiled in
different parts of the monitor independent of each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to run FvwmRearrange automatically when new windows are added,
use FvwmEvent to trigger FvwmRearrange with an <em>add_window</em> event. If using
multiple bounding boxes (like the above example), a ManualPlacement Style
would allow you to place a window in the portion of the screen you wanted
it to be tiled in.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_options">OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FvwmRearrange is only configured using command line options. These options
can come before or after the <em>bounding box</em>, and all start with a '-'.
Below the options are split into categories, <strong>TILING OPTIONS</strong>,
<strong>CASCADING OPTIONS</strong>, <strong>GENERAL OPTIONS</strong>, <strong>RESIZING OPTIONS</strong>,
<strong>FILTERING OPTIONS</strong>, and <strong>ORDERING OPTIONS</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tiling_options">TILING OPTIONS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiling takes the windows inside the bounding box, creates a grid of equal
sized cells based on the number of windows, then resizes and moves the
windows to fill the cells, starting at the top left. The cells are then
filled one row at a time (from left to right) working downward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Windows may have minimum size or size increment EMWH hints, so there
could be gaps between windows or some windows minimum size might be
bigger than the cell. The <em>ResizeHintOverride</em> fvwm <em>Style</em> will
override this behavior and make windows fit in their cells better.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">-auto_tile</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the default behavior which tiles all windows into as close to
a square grid as possible. There can be up to one more column than row
(or one more row than column with <em>-swap</em>), depending on number of windows.
If the option <em>-max_n N</em> is also provided, then the grid will have <em>N</em> more
columns than rows (or <em>N</em> more rows than columns if <em>-swap</em> is included).
This option implies <em>-fill_start</em> so all space will be used. If <em>-fill_end</em>
option is provided, the free space is used at the end instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-tile</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will tile the windows into a single row (or column if with <em>-swap</em>).
If <em>-max_n N</em> is also provided, there will be at most <em>N</em> columns per row
(or <em>N</em> rows per column with <em>-sawp</em>) in the resulting grid. If the grid
has more cells than the number of windows, then the additional cells at
the end will be left open, unless the <em>-fill_start</em> or <em>-fill_end</em> options
are included.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-max_n <em>N</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This option alters how the grid is computed. When using <em>-auto_tile</em> this
gives the number of more columns than rows (or more rows than columns with
<em>-swap</em>). When using <em>-tile</em> this gives the max number of columns, before
a new row is created (or max number of rows with <em>-swap</em>). Default is 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-swap</dt>
<dd>
<p>Swaps the rows and columns, and swaps the direction the cells are filled,
by starting at the top left cell and filling each column downward (from
top to bottom) while working to the right. This use to be called horizontal
sort (with the default being vertical sort), and the old option <em>-h</em> is
an alias for <em>-swap</em>, due to this history.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-fill_start</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will use any unused space in the grid by filling the first row (or
first column with <em>-swap</em>) left open in the grid. This is done by growing
the windows in the row (or column) to fill the unused space. The rest of
the windows will then fill up the rest of the grid.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-fill_end</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will use any unused space in the grid by filling the last row (or
last column with <em>-swap</em>) left open in the grid.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-gap_x <em>N</em>, -gap_y <em>N</em>, -gap <em>N</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This will set the gap between the cells the windows are placed in.
<em>-gap_x</em> sets the size of the horizontal gap, <em>-gap_y</em> sets the size
of the vertical gap, and <em>-gap</em> sets both the size of the horizontal
and vertical gap to be the same. The value <em>N</em> is the number of pixels
between cells, or the width of the line between cells. Default: 0.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cascading_options">CASCADING OPTIONS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cascading takes all windows in the bounding box, places the first window
in the upper left corer of the bounding box, then stacks the second window
just below the first shifted slightly down and to the right, so the previous
window can be seen behind it. This process is repeated placing each window
slightly down and to the right of the previous window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default the windows are resized such that their height and width are
75% of the bounding box&#8217;s height and width. Though as the windows are
cascaded, windows will shrunk so they will stay inside the bounding box.
The <em>-nostretch</em> and <em>-noresize</em> options will prevent windows from being
stretched or resized.</p>

<dd>
<p>Cascade windows inside the bounding box.</p>

<p>Specifies the width of the cascade windows. <em>arg</em> is a percentage of the
bounding box&#8217;s width, or a pixel value if a <em>p</em> is suffixed. Windows are
shrunk if the width pushes them outside the bounding box. Default is 75.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-cascadeh <em>arg</em></dt>

shrunk if the height pushes them outside the bounding box. Default is 75.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-inc_equal</dt>
<dd>
<p>Make the x and y increment equal to the maximum of the two values. This is
useful to get the offset to be equal to the size of the border and title
bar in both directions. This can be combined with <em>-incx, _-incy</em>,
<em>-flatx</em>, and <em>-flaty</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-incx <em>arg</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies an additional horizontal increment which is successively added

pixel value if a <em>p</em> is suffixed. Default is zero.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-incy <em>arg</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies an additional vertical increment which is successively added to

monitor specified by the RandR <em>name</em> instead. If <em>name</em> is equal to "g"
the global monitor (bounding box containing all monitors is used). Since

<h2 id="_bounding_box">BOUNDING BOX</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bounding box is the area in which FvwmRearrange will both find and place
windows when cascading/tiling.  The base bounding box is the working area of
the current or specified monitor via the <em>-screen name</em> option. If the option
<em>-ewmhiwa</em> is provided the base bounding box will ignore the working area and
use the full monitor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up to four numbers can be placed on the command line to specify a bounding
box relative to the base bounding box of the given monitor.  The numbers
give the position of the corners of the bounding box in the following order
(default is "0 0 100 100"):</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock highlight">
<div class="content">
<pre>Left Top Right Bottom</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These numbers are treated as a percentage of the base bounding box. For
instance the bounding box "10 5 85 80" would use a bounding starting 10%
across the working area from the left and ending 85% across the working
area, while starting 5% down the working area from the top and ending
80% down the working area. If any number is suffixed with the letter <em>p</em>,
then it is taken to be a pixel value instead of a percentage.
Specifying zero for any parameter is equivalent to not specifying it
(for example "0 0 0 0" is the same as "0 0 100 100").</p>
