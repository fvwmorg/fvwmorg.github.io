Hi VFWM staff,
-->
Here are several logo suggestions together, please tell me if you would like
them bigger and/or seperated. They were completed in vector graphics so
they can be any size or shape. As you can i see i left a little feline theme
in some of them in case you really want the V in VFWM to remain feline!

p.s. I will submit several more within a few weeks.
<!--

thanks, Michael Gorniak
