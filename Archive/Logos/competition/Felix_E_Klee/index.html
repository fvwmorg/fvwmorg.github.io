First, I want to state that I can easily create design variations (not just
resized images, of course) of the logos below in order to match the size
constraints in the competition rules. However, due to lack of time, I couldn't
provide any variations in advance of the voting process.
</p>

<p>
Note that all logos were created in a vector graphics application, so I can
provide them for example in SVG- or DXF-format. This also means that the colors
and the background can be easily adjusted or set to be transparent (I choose a
white background here for - among other things - better visibility).

<h3>Feline</h3>

<h3>Cloudy Sky</h3>
<p>I created two versions of this logo to show how it can be adjusted to different
aspect ratios by reordering the window squares.</p>

<h3>Stacked Windows</h3>

<h3>Overlapping Windows</h3>

<h3>FVWM Geometric Sans Serif</h3>
<p>IIRC, this was my first design for an FVWM logo. The letters F, V, W, M are arranged
in a geometric window like pattern.</p>

//   <p>
//     In most of my logos I try to reflect the fact that FVWM is a
//     <em>Window</em> Manager. The first five are based on four squares laid
//     out in a geometric "window-like" pattern. The sixth and the eighth were
//     inspired by the idea of overlapping windows in FVWM. Finally, there
//     is also a feline logo (the seventh one). 
//   </p>
//   <p>
//     The logos below all exist in vector format and I plan to put
//     corresponding DXF or, if possible, SVG files here soon. In addition, I
//     might put variations of the logos and some new logos on this page in the
//     next few weeks.
