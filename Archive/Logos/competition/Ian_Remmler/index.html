Hi,

-->
I have created a few logos and put them at
<a href="http://remmler.org/fvwm/">http://remmler.org/fvwm/</a>.
These were all created with vector-based qcad or tgif, so they should
scale nicely (I did do some post-processing in the gimp).  I could
always change colors, add drop shadows, etc., but I concentrated on the
basic shapes.  If anyone has comments or suggestions, please let me
know.  I will probably come up with some more later...

Thanks for taking a look!
        - Ian.
