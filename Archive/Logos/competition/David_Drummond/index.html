I apologize for the file being 49kb, but I don't like compressing files
since it really brings down the quality.

This is a 300 x 180 PNG image
containing a new logo for FVWM.

I will be sumbitting others as right now I just re-did my computer so I
don't have my full taskforce of fonts and images/stock photos at my
fingertips, so there will be a few more.
<!--

On a side note, I have a open-source web design I made and some wallpapers.
If I get them hosted would you like to have a look? I might be able to give
your website a little facelift. :)
