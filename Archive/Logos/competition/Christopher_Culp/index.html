FVWM, Thanks for the opportunity to design your logo. This is my
submission based on what I have read about your company. The logo
involve a few element such as a feline, your name as well as a point
to represent windows. I have attached the file format and size you had
requested as well a little larger version so you could see it a bit
closer. Thanks again, let me know if you have any feedback.
