<p>
The logos can be seen at
<a href="http://www.c-sait.net/fvwm/">http://www.c-sait.net/fvwm/</a>,
they were all made using <a href="http://gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>.

<p>I tried to make simple logos but with a modern design. 
They look like they were made using a construction set.
Square shapes represent the windows managed by fvwm. 

<p>This first one is basic. It introduces the logo.

<p>Some color variations and shading effects.

<p>In next logo, F could mean Floating. It is evokating the sea.

logo is floating.
