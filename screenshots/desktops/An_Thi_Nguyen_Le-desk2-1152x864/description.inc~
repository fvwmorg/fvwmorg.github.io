	  Another  one  by An  Thi-Nguyen   Le.  I got  really  really
	procrast-- I mean, bored, and fooled around with FvwmTheme for
	a while.  This particular scheme is borrowing heavily from the
	Enlightenment theme  AbsoluteE  (the blue  version) and  makes
	heavy use of the stretching pixmap feature  of FvwmTheme.  The
	background   is Tigert's  Blue   Space, the   GKrellM theme is
	something obscure called 3051.
