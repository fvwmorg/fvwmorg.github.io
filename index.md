{% capture fvwmtxt %}
<p>Fvwm is a virtual window manager for the X windows
system. It was originally a feeble fork of TWM
by Robert Nation in 1993 (<a href="{{ site.wikiurl }}/FvwmHistory/">fvwm
history</a>), and has evolved into
the fantastic, fabulous, famous, flexible,
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Archive/Faq/#what-does-fvwm-stand-for">
and so on</a>, window manager we have today.</p>

<p>Fvwm is a ICCCM/EWMH compliant and highly configurable floating window
manager built primarily using Xlib.  Fvwm is configured using a
<a href="{{ site.wikiurl }}/Config/Fvwm2rc/">configuration file</a>,
which is used to configure most aspects of the window manager including
window looks, key bindings, menus, window behavior, additional
<a href="{{ site.wikiurl }}/Modules/">modules</a>, and more.  There is a
<a href="{{ site.wikiurl }}/DefaultConfig/">default configuration</a> file
that can be used as a starting point for writing one's own configuration file.</p>

<p>Fvwm is a light weight window manager and can be configured to be anything from
a small sleek window manager to a full featured desktop environment.  To get the most
out of fvwm, one should be willing to read the documents, and take the time
to write a custom configuration file that suites their needs.  The manual pages and
the <a href="{{ site.wikiurl }}/">fvwm wiki</a> can be used to help learn how to
configure fvwm.</p>

## Getting Fvwm

__Fvwm3__ is the currently supported release of fvwm, and fvwm version 2
is no longer supported. Fvwm3's key new feature is full RandR support for
multihead setups, along with a new DesktopConfiguration that allows independent
virtual desktops for each monitor. Here is a
[list of key differences between fvwm2 and fvwm3](
https://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm3/discussions/878)
along with tips to upgrade an fvwm2 config to an fvwm3 config.

The current release of fvwm3 is version __{{ site.fvwm3-version }}__.
Fvwm3 can be installed in one of the following ways:

+ Many operating systems provide a "fvwm3" package. Note, the
  "fvwm" package most likely refers to fvwm version 2.
+ Build the current release [fvwm3 version {{ site.fvwm3-version }}](
  https://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm3/releases/tag/{{ site.fvwm3-version }})
  from the source tarball.
+ Clone and build the [fvwm3 main branch](
  https://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm3).
+ [Build a Debian .deb package](
  https://github.com/somiaj/fvwm3-debian) from the fvwm3 source.

Report fvwm3 bugs using the [github issues](
https://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm3/issues) tracker.

## Configuring Fvwm

Fvwm starts from a [minimal configuration](
{{ site.wikiurl }}/Config/BlankConfig/)
and allows users to configure as much or little
of their desktop as desired. Starting with
Fvwm 2.6.7 a [default configuration](
{{ site.wikiurl }}/DefaultConfig/) is provided
to give users a starting point that can be edited
instead of configuring from scratch.

When coupled with third party software and custom scripts,
Fvwm becomes a powerful tool to build a full desktop
environment from. If you want a preconfigured desktop
environment using Fvwm, check out the following:
