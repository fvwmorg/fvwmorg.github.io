This page holds some honest reasons from user of FVWM why they use it, and what they like about it. 

> I like FVWM for its speed, customisability, and the fact that it looks a lot like MWM without having to do any work.  :)  -- ThomasAdam

> I use fvwm because it's stable (even the 'unstable' version), and light but, above all, because it gives me the basis and mechanisms to produce an end-result that most closely matches my ideal window manager. (And if that ideal changes, fvwm can be changed with it.) -- slakmagik

> If you start with a simple setup and fiddle with it now and then you'll end up with everything you could want in a desktop environment. It's endlessly configurable, and at this point I can't imagine using anything else. -- jimkalb

> I have been using Fvwm for years. I ran across it when I first started using linux and wanted to get away from the larger desktop environments. It is light weight, reliable and customizable. In the 10+ years of using Fvwm, I have had few issues with it and am able to adapt my configuration as my needs and tastes change. -- jaimos 

> Fvwm is incredible, every tiny detail is configurable and any feature or behaviour of any other window manager you have seen or have imagined can be replicated, tweaked, refined and added to fvwm. Whats more, fvwm is fast, very fast. – taviso

> I like fvwm’s approach - no defaults and everything is up to the user, and I can hardly imagine myself using anything else. Even with my lame coding style, fvwm meets my needs perfectly. – tartan

> Pager window (built-in Virtual Desktop Manager) can easily handle 20 virtual desktops, provides an excellent overview, and allows dragging windows between virtual desktops. – qta

> I stumbled upon fvwm-themes package which basically gave me the impression that “Hey, this thing is actually quite configurable”, so I started to read manpages. A lot. So here I am, the empty spot of WM of my dreams filled with fvwm. – morbusg

> The memory usage is in regions I never dreamed anymore - after starting FVWM it begins with 19%. If I looked at the memory usage of a DE my eyes shed tears. Best thanks to all FVWM developers and big thanks to all helpers on the FVWM forum, too. – TF

> How such a minimal wm, many times underrated, can incorporate the most advanced graphical features and functionabilities, and not hog RAM like crazy. – BodyDrop

> At first, I almost changed my mind instantly until someone gave me a nice .fvwm2rc to play with. Then I was happy… – b15hop

> A few months ago I found Fvwm. Interesting but configs are strange, hobby experiments. Almost gave up and found Fvwm-Kise on Pling. Got hooked on the first sight. – Ivar

> I have the deepest respect for the fvwm developers who are so dedicated and loyal to their project over many years and I want to thank them for their ongoing work and contributions to the Linux community. – pablokal
