# FVWM Decors

A Decor is a collection of configurations for the looks of the windows.
These pages are a collection of example decors that can be used in your
setup. Most of these decors were adopted from
[fvwm-themes](http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net) and are available here
as examples along with the images with any images needed.

These are only examples, for configuration descriptions see
+ [/Config/Decor]({{ "/Config/Decor" | prepend: site.wikibaseurl }})
+ [/Config/VectorButtons]({{ "/Config/VectorButtons" | prepend: site.wikibaseurl }})
