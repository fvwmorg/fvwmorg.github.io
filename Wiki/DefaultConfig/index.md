At the end of this overview, you find the current default configuration 
Fvwm ships with. It is obvious that such a default setting needs to make
choices, and this page tries to explain some of these choices so as to 
enable the (new) user to understand them and to begin adapting the config
to their own needs. Again, this needs to be limited, please refer to the 
man page for a more exhaustive discussion of all available options.

# Functions

There is already a more elaborate page on functions:  
<a href="/wiki/Config/Functions">Functions</a>

# Styles

Styles are settings that, broadly speaking, influence everything that is
related to windows: their looks ("decor"), their behaviour and the way
they are activated (focused) so that you can interact with them.
