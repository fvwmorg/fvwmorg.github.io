<h1>FVWM Config</h1>

<p>FVWM is a <a href="{{ '/Config/Commands' | prepend: site.wikiurl }}">
command</a> driven window manager. In short once FVWM starts it listens
for commands, and then process the actions of the commands issued.
Commands do all things from setting/changing configuration options, to
preforming actions such as moving/resizing/changing windows or moving
between virtual pages and desks.</p>

<p>Here is the list of pages about Fvwm configuration commands:</p>

{% assign pages = site.pages | where:"type","config" | sort:"weight" %}

  {% include wiki_index_item.html mypage=mypage %}
{% endfor %}
{% endcapture %}
