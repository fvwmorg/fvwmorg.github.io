# FvwmForm

## Module Description

FvwmForm provides a mechanism to get user input and act accordingly.
This is achieved by means of a form that the user can fill out,
and from which the user can select options he wants Fvwm to take.
A form consists of five types of times: text labels, single-line
text inputs, mutually-exclusive selections, multiple-choice selections,
and action buttons. These items are arranged into serveral lines,
with a very flexible layout.
