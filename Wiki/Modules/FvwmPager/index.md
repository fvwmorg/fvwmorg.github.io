The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view of the Fvwm desktops which are
specified in the command line. This is a useful reminder of where your
active windows are. Windows in the pager are shown in the same color as
their fvwm decorations.  The pager can be used to change your viewport into
the current desktop, to change desktops, or to move windows around.
