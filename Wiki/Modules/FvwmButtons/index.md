The FvwmButtons module provides a window of buttons which can be used
to build different type of [/Panels]({{ "/Panels" | prepend: site.wikiurl }}).
The window is rectangular and can be split into different rectangular
buttons of varying sizes. Each button can contain text, icons, and even
Swallow other applications.

Buttons can be configured to change their text/icon/colorset when
Active and preform different actions when clicked. Additionally
with use of SendToModule, buttons can be changed by other aspects
of Fvwm.

For a full list of FvwmButtons configuration options see the
FvwmButtons manpage.
