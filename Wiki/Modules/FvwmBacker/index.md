# FvwmBacker

The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to change the  background when
changing  desktops.  Any command can be executed to change the backgrounds.
Actually, any arbitrary command can be sent to fvwm to execute, so  you
could also do things such as changing window border colors, etc.
