# FvwmCommand

**Note:** In fvwm3, a new module `FvwmPrompt` exists that is a combination
of FvwmCommand and FvwmConsole. Though due to golang dependencies, this new
module is not in wide use yet. FvwmConsole and FvwmCommandS are currently
still available until FvwmPrompt is more widely used.

## Description

FvwmCommand lets you monitor fvwm transaction and issue fvwm commands
from a shell command line or scripts. FvwmCommand takes each argument
as a fvwm command. Quotes can be used to send commands including
spaces. FvwmCommand 'FvwmPager 0 1'

## Configuration and Use

The only configuration needed is to run the server FvwmCommandS from your
config file. One such way is to do this when FVWM starts with:

{% highlight fvwm %}
AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmCommandS
{% endhighlight %}

Once the server is running you can issue commands to fvwm from the command
line in your terminals or from scripts. To do so just run

{% highlight shell %}
FvwmCommand "Command"
{% endhighlight %}
