<p>Here's my first attempts at using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a>.</p>

<p>This logo isn't  serious  -  it's  just  for  a  laugh.  Having  a
background  in  Astronomy, it is natural to think of the <i>bigger</i>
picture. I couldn't find a picture of the universe, so:</p>

<p>The Feline theme (not my idea) is a great one!</p>

<p>What do palm trees have to do with FVWM? Dunno, but it looks good.</p>
